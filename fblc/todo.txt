* Add a static pass to type check an environment.
* Always return nice error messages to the user, don't just fail an assertion.
* Be able to parse from a string as well as a file.
  - Then add a '-e' option to fblc to specify an arbitrary expression to
    evaluate in the context of the given program.
* Be able to parse from a list of files instead of just one?
  This will help for tests or other programs that share some common functions.
* Implement support for processes.
* Write a man page for fblc?
* Write a vim syntax for fblc?
* Figure out how to run code coverage, and use it to identify holes in my
  tests.
* Start work on a calculator program as a basic test for processes.
