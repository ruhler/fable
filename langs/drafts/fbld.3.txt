FBLD Version 3
==============
There are some problems with fbld language version 2. This document attempts
to understand the problems and propose an update to the language to address
them.

Use Cases
---------
1. UBNat - be able to define abstract interface with private implementation.
Works perfectly in fbld 2.

2. Generic List type with 'map' function.
The List module is parameterized by type T, because type parameters can only
be introduced at the module level. The map function
(map :: (a->b) -> [a] -> [b]) needs 2 type parameters.  This means it would
have to be defined in a separate module, which is very tedious.

3. Applying List map to map lists of internal types.
Assume a module has some internal data type Foo and a list of Foo, and wants
to map it to a list of another internal data type Bar. To invoke the map
function requires an mdefn with the function mapping Foo to Bar, which
requires the Foo and Bar functions be exposed publicly.

4. Generic List type with 'find' function.
The find function depends on the list type T and a module instance of Eq,
which means it would have to be defined in a separate module from the rest of
List, which is very tedious.

5. Applying List find to internal types.
Assume a module has some internal data type Foo and a list of Foo and wants to
call find. This requires defining an mdefn of mtype Eq for Foo, which requires
Foo be public.

Separation of Concerns
----------------------
The source of the problems with fbld 2 is the overloading of modules for both
type parameters and public/private abstractions. But as we have seen, it is
often the case we want to use type parameters in private, and we want to group
declarations with different parameterization in the same public/private
abstraction.

To better understand the needs of polymorphism and public/private abstraction,
let us imagine how they would look if they were done entirely separately.

Polymorphism
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fblc has types, funcs, and procs. Polymorphism means we should be able to
parameterize types by types, funcs by types and funcs, and procs by types
funcs and procs.

Proposal: generalize all declarations to support static parameters.

struct Foo<T1, T2, ...>(...);
union Foo<T1, T2, ...>(...);
func Foo<T1, T2, ...; FT1 f1, FT2 f2, ...>(...) ...;
proc Foo<T1, T2, ...; FT1 f1, FT2 f2, ..., PT1 p1, PT2 p2, ...>(...) ...;

To use a type, function, or process requires supplying all static parameters.

This is simple and straight forward conceptually. Some questions to resolve:
1. How best to specify func and proc arguments syntactically?
Option: func(T1 a1, T2 a2, ... ; TR) f1

It is inconsistent to pull the function name out from between 'func' and the
argument types, which is annoying. Perhaps we could make the rest of the
language consistent to match: func(...) f { ... };

We've already seen from fbld 2 that it's nice to be able to specify iref and
mref. We could introduce a grouping construct:

mtype<T1, T2,...> IName {
  func f1(...);
  func f2(...);
};

mdefn<T1, T2, ...; I1 m1, I2 m2, ...; IName<T1, T2, ...> MName {
  func f1(...) ...;
  func f2(...) ...;
};

Then you could pass modules. For the case of passing a single function, you
would need to define a wrapper mtype. Slightly tedious for passing simple
functions, but works great for passing more complex types. Lets us have
consistent syntax for distinguishing between different functions.

Presumably we would want to support nested type declarations in general. This
can be achieved by allowing abstract mdefns to be declared as part of an
mtype. For example:

mtype NumericEnum {
  mdefn Numeric< ; ; Numeric>;
  mdefn Enum< ; ; Enum> enum;
};

There may be some details to work out, such as how to bundle existing groups
together without having to define copies of all the methods, and whether
that's possible to do for groups that define types.

When constructing a value of an mtype, you want the mdefn body to have direct
access to local type, func, and proc declarations.

2. Are the static parameters being passed generalized declarations that can
themselves be provided with static parameters, or do they have all static
parameters fully applied already?

Having static parameters fully applied makes things simple, but why be
restrictive? There shouldn't be anything difficult (other than possibly
syntactically) to support more general things. This might let us do monadic
kinds of computations for example.

bind :: (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b
bind<M<T>, A, B; Function<A, M<B>> f>(M<A> ma ; M<B>) ...

I don't think you could do this kind of thing otherwise. Maybe it's not so
important. Maybe it's a use case not to worry about to start. If it turns out
to be important in practice, it will make itself known.

3. It can be tedious to list a lot of parameters. Should we provide a
mechanism for grouping together collections of parameters?

For things like "Numeric", there are lots of functions. We definitely want a
way to group them together. See also the answer to (1).

4. Do we have to worry about any issues with multiparameter type classes with
functional dependencies?
No. This is a side effect of Haskell trying to infer the type class
automatically. As long as we explicitly specify the type class, there is not
issue at all with this kind of thing.

Public/Private
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Group declarations into abstract modules. Each module has an interface and an
implementation. Users of the module know only about its interface. The
implementation may define extra declarations not externally visible.

For example, we introduce the following concepts:

mtype - A module interface. The module interface contains abstract type,
function, and process declarations.

mtype Foo {
  type X;   # abstract type declared in module implementation.
  struct Foo(...);    # normal type, forming part of the interface.
  func Bar(...);      # function without body
  proc Sludge(...);   # process without body.
  ...
};

mdefn - A module definition.

mdefn Bar implements Foo {
  ...
};

An entity is referred to based on the module it belongs to. For example: X@Foo
is the type X defined in module Foo.

Benefits of public/private abstraction:
 - Gives some form of namespace, so multiple declarations can have same name.
 - Reduces namespace clutter by allowing private declarations.
 - Provides clear interfaces for users to use.
 - Allows implementation to be changed without fear of breaking users.

Points of interest:
* Preference is to have non-recursive modules: a module cannot depend on
  another module that depends on the module itself. Otherwise it gets really
  hard to figure out what's going on.

* You can have multiple different implementations of the same interface. For
  example, multiple kinds of Map implementations: ListMap, TreeMap, HashMap.

* Can module interfaces be nested? Or, related, does each module have a single
  interface, or can it have multiple interfaces?

* Can modules have nested module definitions? How would these interact with
  local type, func, and proc declarations?

  In practice we could do like Java and Haskell - have support for
  hierarchical module names, but otherwise don't have any support for nested
  modules. This satisfies most use cases just fine, even if it doesn't give
  compiler gaurentee that nobody is peeking into what you want to be internal
  module definitions.
  
Random Note
^^^^^^^^^^^
Functions can always be redefined in terms of other functions. This lets you
have two names for the same function. This is no problem at all.

Types can't be redefined as duplicates of other types, because for the case of
types, we need to check if two types are the same or not. This is why we have
a difference between a type parameter and an abstract type. The abstract type
acts as the types definition. A type parameter lets you use a type defined
elsewhere.

Proposed Unification
--------------------
It makes sense to use the same notion of mtype/mdefn for both polymorphic
bundles and public/private modules. Having two so closely related concepts
with different semantics would be too confusing. It makes sense to support
nested modules. The one point that needs to be reconciled between the two is
the question of recursive modules.

For polymorphic modules, we expect the definitions to be in scope of other
local definitions, which suggests they are in scope of other module
definitions in a recursive way. For public/private modules, we really would
rather not allow recursive module hierarchies (module A depends on B, B
depends on A), because it makes it impossible to reason about a module from
the ground up, one module at a time.

What does it look like to disallow recursive modules used in the polymorphic
way? It feels really weird to allow modules to interact recursively with other
declarations, but not other module declarations.

I propose we have two slightly different notions.
1. The notion of mtype, mdefn interface and implementation.
Interface and implementation of a collection of type, func, proc, mtype, and
mdefn declarations. Used for grouping declarations together.

2. The notion of a module or code unit.
A peice of code that can be understood in isolation, subject to the
understanding of non-recursively dependent code units that themselves can be
understood in isolation. A module is defined as having an mtype interface and
mdefn definition, but it may also have mtypes and mdefns inside it that are
not themselves considered distinct modules.

We can think of the language in tiers:
1. fblc let you define a collection of mutually recursive declarations. The
entire program had to be understood as a single unit all at once.
2. fbld lets you define multiple modules, each of which is its own collection
of mutually recursive declarations. Each module has to be understood as a
single unit all at once, but modules can be composed in a non-recursive
fashion to allow for larger programs that cannot be understood in isolation.
3. Some future extension of fbld will be needed to allow multiple modules to
be collected together into libraries. No need to worry about this until I
reach that scale of programming and better understand the needs.

More details on proposed unification:
* Pass fun and proc static args only through mtype/mdefn.
* mtype/mdefn within a module may be mutually recursive.
* Modules may not be mutually recursive.
* Optional <type> args to struct, union, mtype
* Optional <type;mref> args to func, proc, mdefn


Notes from three big issues with the proposed fbld version 3.

Namespaces for Hierarchical Modules
-----------------------------------
If modules can recursively define other modules, then what belongs to the
namespace of a module? What names can you refer to from the module?

The tension comes from two ends.
1. Local submodules want access to parent namespace.
For example, defining an instance of Eq for a locally defined type:

  struct MyPair(Int a, Int b);

  module EqMyPair(Eq<MyPair>) {
    # Local access to 'MyPair'
    func Equals(MyPair a, MyPair b) ...
  };

2. Don't want name polution from global scope.
The top level global scope is unboundedly large. Anyone could potentially add
a new thing to the top level global scope at any time under any name. Whatever
name they choose would lead to a name conflict for any module that has access
to the global scope.

Straw man proposal for name access:
A.
* A module can access anything it defines locally.
* To access things defined in children, used qualified names.
* A module can access anything defined locally in any parent module.

This suffers from problem (2).

B.
* Same as (A), except that local definitions shadow definitions from parent
  modules.

This addresses problem (2), but introduces a new problem. Imagine three
nested modules: A is a parent of B is a parent of C. C refers to modules of A
internally. Now, if B introduces any local definitions that shadow the
declarations C refers to in A, then those changes to B break A. That seems
like a bad thing, because B doesn't know what references C has to things in A.

C.
* A module must explicitly import anything it needs from its immediate parent
  module's namespace.

If a nested sub-module wants to reference a global entity, it is only allowed
to do so if its container module imports that global entity. Using the example
from before, if C wants to reference something in A, then B must first import
that entity from A and C then import that from B.

Rationalle:
* In order to make use of sub modules, you have to know what their
dependencies are. You have to construct the required environment for the
submodule to be used. Thus it makes sense to require a module to understand
all of its submodule's external dependencies.
* To have full control over its own name space, a module should explicitly
import anything external that it needs, under whatever name it chooses. This
makes perfect sense.

The slight difference from the shadowing case (B) is that you must explicitly
list imports all the way up the module chain. I claim that is the key,
important distinction.

Complex Polymorphic Kinds
-------------------------
Polymorphism allows declarations to be parameterized by types. The question
is, are these just simple types, or can a declaration be parameterized by a
parameterized type?

The canonical example is a generic monadic function that wants to be
paramterized by some monadic type M, where M is itself parameterized by simple
type T.

The problem is, if you can support passing parameterized types as arguments,
then parameterized types (and other things in general) really ought to be
first class citizens. It should be easy to describe any kind of parameterized
type. You run into questions of: How to do partial application of a
parameterized type? How to reorder the type arguments of a parameterized type?
Can you make a parameterized parameterized type?

For example, how could you define a monadic instance for Tuple, parameterized
by the type of the second element of the tuple?

You would need some form of type lambda or partial application:

module TupleMonad<T> (Monad<\B -> Tuple<B, T>>) { ... }

Or complex alias:

alias TupleX<A><B> = Tuple<A, B>

Until we can figure out a simple way to cover all these cases, let's leave out
this complexity from the language and only allow simple kinded type
parameters.

Proposal for simple-ish way to cover all cases:
1. Allow partial application of type parameters.
2. Have 'alias' declarations for all kinds of declarations.
Note: no need to have anonymous type lambdas. We would only need those if we
wanted to bind local arguments. But that case is not relevant to us. Defining
separate static names via 'alias' works just fine.

Example:

struct Tuple<A, B>(A first, B second);
alias ReverseTuple<A, B> Tuple<B, A>;
module ReverseTupleMonad<T>(Monad<ReverseTuple<T>>) { ... };
