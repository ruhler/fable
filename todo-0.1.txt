Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

Release Related:
* Write release notes for release 0.1
* Make the official release.

Build Related:
* BUILDSTAMP results in a -.gcno file for code coverage?
  Is that a problem? Do we need to handle it? How?
* Reconsider use of BUILDSTAMP in fble-test, fble-app, fble-stdio.
 Because this requires users to define BUILDSTAMP when they do their own
 compiles.

Documentation Related:
* Update usage help text with info about FBLE_PACKAGE_PATH, -p, and --package
  options.
* Figure out how to customize usage for compiled binaries
 - for example, fble-invaders should say fble-invaders in the usage, not
   fble-app.
* Generate fbld based man pages for binaries.
  fble-app
  fble-md5
  fble-sat
  fble-graphics
  fble-perf-profile
  fble-stdio
  fble-invaders
  fble-pinball
  fble-test
* Document default fble package path in man pages?
  Meaning, the exact value we end up installing.
* Generate man pages for library functions via fbld.
* Add version numbers to generated docs?
