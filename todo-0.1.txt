Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

* Add a way to specify package path on the command line?
* Figure out why there isn't a space before options in fble-test -h output.
* Too many blank lines in usage generated help output?

Documentation Related:
* usage output does not work well when piping to less
  It shows a bunch of [ESC like stuff in the output text.

* Clean up option parsing, usage text, man pages for each of the following.
  - Switch to using new helper functions on all existing binaries.
    Replacing uses of PrintHelp, PrintVersion, PrintHeader.

  - fble-stdio
  - fble-app

  - fble-md5
  - fble-sat
  - fble-graphics
  - fble-invaders
  - fble-pinball

* Document default fble package path in man pages?
  Meaning, the exact value we end up installing.
* Generate man pages for library functions via fbld.
* Add version numbers to generated docs?

Release Related:
* Verify the release candidate every way I can.
  Automating as much as that verification as possible. Including:
  - Make sure we can build, check, and install from release distribution.
  - Walk through tutorials and make sure those work.
  - Check if we can disable SDL properly?
  - Proofread all tutorials?
* Write release notes for release 0.1
* Make the official release.
