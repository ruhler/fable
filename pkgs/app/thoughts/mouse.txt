How to support mouse in apps?

Initial proposal is to be simple:
* Give a mouse event when the mouse moves.
* Don't worry about button presses yet, but when we want them, add a mouse
  event for button press.
* Rely on the app to render the pointer image to start. See if that's
  efficient enough.

Don't worry about touchscreen or optimizations or anything fancy yet. One step
at a time.

I expect the mouse event to take the position of the mouse and/or the change
in the mouse. I could see how both could be useful. See what SDL does.

It makes sense to have the coordinates be in the same coordinate system as
drawing, right?

Mouse event:
* Coordinates of mouse relative to window.
* Relative motion in X/Y directions. Relative is relative to the last motion
  event.

Coordinate system for drawing is: (0,0) is upper right, +x to the right, +y to
the bottom of the screen.

Let's start a demo app, to help with (ug, manual) testing of App features. To
start it can be a black background that draws a small green square around the
mouse position.

Demo app with small green square around the mouse works great. We should
probably clean up the demo app to target 60 FPS and only redraw on tick
instead of for every change to the mouse position.

Next step for mouse is button click. Should be easy enough.

To be consistent with keyboard events, I would suggest:
  mouse_down
  mouse_up

With MouseButton of Left, Middle, or Right.

And include coordinates of the mouse when it was clicked.

For the demo app, we could toggle the color of the green square whenever you
click the mouse. Or, turn it a different color on mouse_down versus mouse_up.
