Fble 0.4 Release
================
What's the plan?

Big categories of work right now are:
* Performance
 - Better data value packing.
 - Function call inlining.
* Modular compilation
* Debugger
* Fbld in C.
* Fbld core library revision.
* Fble standard library.
* New apps.

My vote:
1. Start with fbld in C. That should give some performance baseline and also
improve build times a bunch.

Then go from there, whatever I feel like. We have a pretty solid list of
options for things to work on. There's more than enough here for a release.
What's nice is these big things are mostly orthogonal.
