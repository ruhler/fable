Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

* Update all .fbld docs for new format.
 - fbld and fble specs.
* Note in fbld spec that same line arg starts after the first space.

* Generate man pages for library functions via fbld.

* Document default fble package path in man pages?
  We can get it from $::config::datadir/fble
  How best to pass that into the docs?
  Auto-generate a .tcl file that defines a config tag? Like: @config[datadir]?
  
* Add version numbers to generated docs?
  - For man pages, ideally we add it to 'source' of the .TH call. But what's a
    natural way to pass that information into there? Create a @man tag for man
    documents? Maybe hold off until we have section 3 man pages too.

Release Related:
* Verify the release candidate every way I can.
  Automating as much as that verification as possible. Including:
  - Make sure we can build, check, and install from release distribution.
  - Walk through tutorials and make sure those work.
  - Check if we can disable SDL properly?
  - Proofread all tutorials?
  - Review all the man pages and usage help text?
  - Double check all links in the generated web page? And proofread?
* Write release notes for release 0.1
* Make the official release.
