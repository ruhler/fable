Truth Table
===========
A truth table is a total mapping of an input sequence of bits to an output
sequence of bits. Both the number of bits in the input sequence and the number
of bits in the output sequence are fixed statically. Typically the number of
bits in the input sequence is small, not more than half a dozen bits, because
the size of the truth table grows exponentially in the number of input bits.

For example, consider the boolean AND operation. The AND operation takes two
inputs, A and B, and produces a single output Z. The output Z is 1 if and only
if both of the inputs A and B are 1. The AND operation can be described using
a truth table:

  A B | Z
  ----|--
  0 0 | 0
  0 1 | 0
  1 0 | 0
  1 1 | 1

Syntax
------
Here we define a syntax for interpreting a sequence of characters as a truth
table. 

As a sample of the syntax, the AND operation described above is represented
using the following sequence of characters:

  TruthTable(A, B; Z) {
    00: 0;
    01: 0;
    10: 0;
    11: 1;
  }

More precisely, the syntax for a truth table is as follows:
1. The keyword 'TruthTable'
2. Lists of input names and output names surrounded by parentheses.
A semicolon is used to divide the list of input names, which comes first, from
the list of output names. Each list is a comma separated list of names, where
a name is a sequence of characters not containing punctuation or white space
(TODO: Be more precise about what a name is).
The input list may be empty. The output list should contain at least one
element. The names of all inputs and outputs should be distinct.
3. A sequence of table entries surrounded by braces.
Each entry consists of a sequence of binary digits, one for each input,
followed by a colon, followed by a sequence of binary digits, one for each
output, then a semicolon. The sequences of binary digits may contain the
characters '0', '1', and '_', where '_' is used to group digits to make it
easier to read the table entries, but is otherwise ignored.
The table entries must be complete and have distinct input bit sequences; if
there are N inputs, there should be 2^N^ table entries. The table entries may
be listed in any order. 

TODO: Be more precise about where whitespace is allowed.
