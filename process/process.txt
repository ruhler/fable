Brainstorm for process:

A process has a set of inputs and outputs that it can read repeatedly for
subsequent inputs and write for subsequent outputs. This can be used to write
stream programming. Inputs are read blocking. 

Sample programs to write:

A. Increment each value on the stream:
incr(int in; int out) {
  loop {
    int x <- in;
    out(x+1);
  }
}

B. Repeat the given input value on the output that many times:
dup(int in; int out) {
  loop {
    int x <- in;
    for (int i = 0; i < x; i++)
      out(x);
    }
  }
}

C. Interpolate points:
interp(int in; int out) {
  int target = 0;
  loop {
    int location = target;
    target <- in;
    while (location > target) {
      out(location);
      location = location - 1;
    }
    while (location < target) {
      out(location);
      location = location + 1;
    }
  }
}
