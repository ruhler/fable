Fble 0.5 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.5 release.

* Add spec test that would catch the bug if we failed to GcRealloc a value
  before ref assignment.
  - ref assign to a value which is stack alloc -> gc alloc -> ref.
  - The issue being, after substitution, we would end up with:
    stack -> gc -> stack, and when we return that, we would gc allocate it
    into: gc -> gc -> stack, and that stack value would then be dangling and
    likely to get overwritten.

* Write release notes.
 - Add update to treatment of kinds.
