Images
======
For the set game use case, I have drawn some icons in inkscape, exported to
png. How can we make use of these images in an fble App?

In this particular instance, the images are described using vector paths, with
stroke widths, end marker, and curved joins. In general you could imagine
someone has some fancy editor they use to create an svg or png or other bitmap
image. For example, you could consider fonts as a collection of images
rendered with a specific technique we may not want to build into fble.

Any way you look at it, we'll need some representation of the image in fble.
We could use 'Drawing' with a bunch of rectangles, or something more specific.
We could introduce the option to define a drawing that we can refer to later
in the AppIO API. Somehow we'll need to specify an image, either in code, or
using a routine that can load one from an input stream. Then there is question
of filesystem support for loading these kinds of assets.

Questions are:
* Filesystem support for loading images?
* Some sort of caching mechanism to improve performance?
* Library in fble for drawing fancy vector graphics?
* Special representation for drawings, or something built on top of what we
  already have?
* Library support for different image formats?
