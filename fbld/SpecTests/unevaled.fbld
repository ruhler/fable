@test error 10:14   
@ ignored.

Note: the goal is to have an unevaluated command outside of the test body,
because the test body is otherwise ignored. We use a hack based on the
implementation of spec-test.run.tcl that replaces the normal final arg marker
with spaces to trick it into parsing the correct test metadata without
starting a final argument.

The command @x is never fully evaluated.

End of test.
