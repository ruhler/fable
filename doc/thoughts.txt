* It would be nice to have an infrastructure for checking and defining errors.
This could be used for static assertions, dynamic checks, and test cases.
The idea is: we have a way to report an error, including file and line number,
the type of error, and additional dynamic information. Somehow that can be
appropriately interpreted and reported.

Use C++ exceptions? Should it be part of the interface to a function what
errors it can encounter? Is there a difference between: Something unexpected
happened and you used this function wrong?

* Maybe it would be nice to have an infrastructure for adding debug printf
  statements?

* It would be nice if the make file could make itself right.
As in, make it easy to automatically compute dependencies if possible.
