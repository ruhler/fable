Fble Release 0.2
================

Too early days to think about a release, but we can think about what to work
on. Priority should be writing some serious fble apps. I propose the
following:

* fbld - implement it in fble. I bet some interesting things come out of this.
* sat - improve the sat solver. Maybe from what we learn we could implement a
  decent enough sat solver in C for smten?
* png viewer.
* floating point benchmark game.
* Hardware language something or other.

That is plenty to keep me busy. It won't stress the language too much. Once we
are done with those we can think about stressing the language with things like
persistent storage and other OS related functionality.

Next question is: which of these to focus on first? Because I'll have trouble
if I try to do them all at once.

My vote is: get some work in on sat, and think about fbld in the background.
Worry about png, floating point, and hardware language something or other
later.

We've come far enough now I think it's time to focus on getting the next
release out. In particular, this release has a lot of work done on the sat
solver and fbld applications in fble. The main fble language improvements are
performance, struct copy, and stack size.

There's a long way to go to clean up loose ends to get the release out. All
the more reason to switch focus on release instead of thinking about new
topics.

Documentation is the biggest thing. Getting parity with what we had before we
replaced the fbld implementation:

* Rewrite the fbld spec.
* Fix issues with generated documentation.
* Support for syntax highlighting.
 - Which may want improvements to html escaping.
