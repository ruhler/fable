Fble 0.4 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.4 release.

* pprof viewer: show percentage with each value?

* Add tests for /Core/String/Map%.

* Avoid exporting map directly as the module value. Wrap it in a module struct
  instead.

* Remove /Core/Map/Tree%.
 - Port everyone over to /Core/Map instead.

* Test and fix windows TCP sockets support.

* Return error messages in Sockets interface on failure to connect, serve, accept?
  Yes, definitely needed. Or an error code?

* Need a way to explicitly close sockets connection?
  For example, elinks seems to think fble-pprof isn't done writing its
  response. Or is there some other issue going on there?

* EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE with /Core/Stdio%.Main@ True/False rather than
  zero and non-zero? Is that more portable?

* Add helper macros for defining static FbleString and FbleModulePath?

* Add spec tests for full coverage.
 - Try all the funny non-printable characters in identifier names?
 - Test fble-disassemble with type dependencies?
 - Test FbleCompileModule where typecheck of module fails?
   Why isn't that covered already by basically every compile-error test?

* Update tutorials for changes since last release
 - modular compilation in particular

* Get rid of fble-deps, in favor of a generic --make-deps option to fble
  binaries?
  Remove use of fbledeps in spec tests?
* Add --compile option to fble-deps?
* Figure out how to make generated c for fble modules satisfy -Wpedantic?
  - FbleString static initialization is one issue.

* export builtin modules in a header file somewhere?
  Instead of having users export themselves?

* Add test and fix for this case:
 1. We load builtin A, which loads dependent builtin B
 2. We load .fble C, which depends on builtin B
 At what point do we check and load the type information for B?

* Fix exit status in fble-stdio.fbld
  And maybe others since changing to FbleMain?

* Add test for .fble vs. .fble.@ type for main module as well as dependant
  module.
* Test for .fble.@ of dependant file present but with bad syntax.
* Test for malformed .fble of dependant file gives no error when well formed
  .fble.@ is there and we are just compiling the module.

* Add --help option to fbld programs to output usage.

* Fbld C rewrite
 - Separate out loc.h, text.h, markup.h, etc?
 - Change FbldMarkup type to more explicitly distinguish between the different
   kinds of markups.
 - Figure out how to associate a location with empty markup.
 - Avoid constructing markups with singleton sequences?

* Fix potential GC gen overflow?
 - See thoughts/fble-0.3/stack_alloc.txt for details.

Doc Comments
 - dccheck should require @type present in @value content?
 - Add support for @union and @enum doc comments?
 - Add support for abstract typedef struct doc comments?
 - Would be nice to have SEE ALSO section for library man pages.

Tutorials
 - Add exercises to exercise each main point in every tutorial.
 - C API
 - /App/App%
 - /Core/Test%
