Debug
=====
Thoughts on how to improve the fble debugger situation.

Current problems with debug:
* You can't debug with interpreted code.
* You can't debug with C backend.
* Stepping through fble code requires inlining the FbleCall in aarch64, which
  is a pain to maintain.

Challenges with a dwarf based approach:
* I don't have a way to generate architecture agnostic dwarf info for
  interpreted code or C backend.
* I need a better way than inlining FbleCall in aarch64 to be able to single
  step through code.

Let's start with the second. Any magic in dwarf we can use to label FbleCall
as a trampoline function? Except, we don't want to call it that when debugging
C code directly, so this would have to be a gdb thing, right?

Let's review the dwarf spec anyway, just in case.
