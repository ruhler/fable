@tutorial Install
 This tutorial shows you how to install fble for use with subsequent tutorials.

 The latest release of fble is available as a source tarball on github
 at @url[https://github.com/ruhler/fable]{}. To install fble you'll need to
 download or checkout the source and manually build and install.
 
 @section Source
  The source code for fble is available from github at
  @url[https://github.com/ruhler/fable]{}. Download and extract the latest
  release, or run the following to check out the latest source code:
 
  @code[sh] @
   git clone https://github.com/ruhler/fable.git
 
 @section Requirements
  The README file included with the source code has the definitive list of
  requirements for fble. On a debian-based system, the following command can
  be used to get all required packages for fble:
 
  @code[sh] @
   apt install \
     expect binutils bison coreutils \
     gcc gdb diffutils grep groff-base \
     ninja-build libgl-dev libsdl2-dev tcl8.6
 
 @section Build
  Fble comes with a configure script to initialize the build scripts and
  specify where to install fble. You can choose whether to install fble in a
  standard system location, such as /usr/local, or in your own home directory
  in some location. For this example, we'll install fble to an 'install'
  directory alongside the source code.
 
  @code[sh] @
   cd fable
   mkdir install
   INSTALL=`pwd`/install
   ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL
   ninja && ninja install

  @subsection Documentation
   Documentation is generated and installed by default. You can find the
   generated man pages in the @l{$INSTALL/man} directory. You can find
   generated html documentation in the @l{$INSTALL/share/doc/fble} directory,
   including html generated for these tutorials.
 
  @subsection Tests
   If you would like to run the full test suite, you can also run:
  
   @code[sh] @
    ninja check

   If all tests are passing, it should output a line that looks something like
   this:

   @code[txt] @
    Test Summary: 1163 passed, 4 xfailed, 0 failed, 1167 total

   Some tests are marked as 'xfailed', which means they are known to fail.
   Those expected failures can safely be ignored.
 
 @section Environment Setup
  Subsequent tutorials all assume the environment has been set up for easy
  access to the fble installation. If you haven't installed to a standard
  install path, you can manually set up the environment by modifying PATH and
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables.
 
  The following environment setup makes use of the @l{INSTALL} variable
  defined above:
 
  @code[sh] @
   export PATH=$INSTALL/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INSTALL/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 
  To test your environment is properly set up, try running a hello world
  program that ships with the fble installation.
 
  @code[sh] @
   fble-stdio -p core -m /Core/Stdio/HelloWorld%
 
  If all goes well, you should see @l{"hello, world"} printed to the terminal.
  Make sure to use the full command, including the final @l{%} character which
  is part of the syntax for identifying the hello world program.

  You're now ready to work through the rest of the fble tutorials to learn all
  about fble.
 
 @section Vim Syntax Highlighting
  Fble ships with syntax files for use with the Vim text editor. If you are a
  Vim users, you can install the Vim files from the top level of the source
  directory using:
 
  @code[sh] @
   mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftdetect ~/.vim/ftplugin ~/.vim/indent ~/.vim/syntax
   cp vim/ftdetect/* ~/.vim/ftdetect
   cp vim/ftplugin/* ~/.vim/ftplugin
   cp vim/indent/* ~/.vim/indent
   cp vim/syntax/* ~/.vim/syntax
 
  Now when you open up a @l{.fble} file in Vim, you'll get pretty syntax
  highlighting.
 
  It's also useful to set the path to be able to find .fble files from their
  module paths. For example, add the following to your ~/.vimrc file:
 
  @code[vim] @
   autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.fble setlocal path=$INSTALL/share/fble/*
 
  That way you can type @l{gf} with the cursor over a module path to jump to
  the code for that module.

  Head over to the @fbld[HelloWorld.fbld][HelloWorld] tutorial to write your
  very own hello world program in fble.
