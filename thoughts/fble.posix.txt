Fble Posix
==========
Goal is to come up with a posix-like interface for fble. For first version,
goals are:
* Be able to use it instead of Stdio interface.
* Be able to use it instead of md5 interface.
* Be able to use it for all tutorials out of the box, so users don't have to
  worry about writing their own main drivers to start; they can focus on the
  language itself.
* Be able to implement things like 'grep -R' that traverse directories.

High level, I want an API to allow:
* Access to command line arguments.
* Able to return exit status.
* Be able to read stdin, write stdout, stderr.
* Be able to open files by name for read and/or write.
* Be able to traverse directories.

Guidelines are:
* Stick with approach taken by posix. No fancy attempts to come up with
  something 'better'.
* But simplify the interface as much as I can/need for now.

Strawman:
* Byte@ - byte type. Used anywhere char is used in C as well.
* Fd@ - abstract file descriptor type.
  Don't use int, because I think we don't need that much generality, and that
  way we don't have to worry about an int type in the interface.
* (Fd@) { M@<Maybe@<Byte@>>; } Read
  - Read next byte from file descriptor, or Nothing if end of file. 
* (Fd@, Byte@) { M@<Unit@>; } Write
  - Write a character to a file.
* Fd@ stdin, Fd@ stdout, Fd@ stderr
  - Standard file descriptors.
* (List@<Byte@>) M@<List@<Dirent@>> readdir
  Where Dirent@ is *(List@<Byte@> name, FileType@ type), and 
  FileType@ is DT_REG, DT_DIR, DT_UNKNOWN, etc.
  Hopefully it's okay to read the entire directory at once instead of one by
  one? I really hope the directory isn't too big. But this is a simpler
  interface than one by one.
* (List@<Byte@> path, Mode@ mode) { M@<Maybe@<Fd@>> } Open
  Where Mode@ is r, r+, w, w+, a, a+ as in fopen.
* Main has type: (List@<List@<Byte@>> args) { M@<Byte@>;}
  Except specifying M@ and the full interface above as well.
  The return Byte@ is exit status.

---

Some proposed revisions:
* Use String@ for args and file paths.
 - It feels much more natural than lists of bytes, and it's hard for me to
   imagine much in the way of practical use cases for bytes that don't have
   corresponding characters.
* Encapsulate Fd@ inside a function.

Revised proposal:
* Byte@ - byte type.
* Read@ = M@<Maybe@<Byte@>>, for reading bytes from an (implicit) file.
* Write@ = (Byte@) { M@<Unit@>; }, for writing to an (implicit) file.
* File@ = *(Read@ read@, Write@ write), for a read/write file.
* Read@ stdin, Write@ stdout, Write@ stderr
* (List@ pathname, Mode@ mode) { M@<Maybe@<File@>>; } Open
   Where Mode@ is r, r+, w, w+, a, a+ as in fopen.
   Maybe eventually we want to add more in the way of error codes, but don't
   worry about that for now.
* (String@) M@<List@<Dirent@>> ReadDir
  Where Dirent@ is *(String@ name, FileType@ type), and 
  FileType@ is DT_REG, DT_DIR, DT_UNKNOWN, etc.
* Main@ = (List@<String@> args) { M@<Byte@>;}
  Plus M@, Monad@<M@>, and access to above interface.

All of this can go into and be called /Core/Stdio%. We can update that
incrementally and in place with the new functionality.

Once everything is in place for Stdio, we can start using that for md5. I'm on
board. I think we have enough to get started. What's the plan?

1. Move definition of Byte@ to core package.
 - Will need to decide what interface I want.
2. Return Byte@ instead of Bool@ in Main@.
3. Define Read@. Start using that for 'stdin'.
4. Define Write@. Start using that for 'stdout', 'stderr'.
5. Define File@, Open. Start using that for md5.

Skip ReadDir for now, until I have a better motivating example.

The biggest challenge, I think, will be coming up with a convenient way to
define and use helper functions like getline and puts. Oh, and coming up with
the interface for Byte@. That's hard too.

Brainstorm of possible interfaces for Byte@:
A. List of Bit@
B. Struct with 8 Bit@ fields.
C. Struct with Bit4@ hi, Bit4@ lo.

My preference is (C), because it clearly encodes the number of bits and it has
structure that scales to any number of bits. We could use a different name for
this. Maybe Bit8@, or Int8@ or Uint8@?

Cool. That's easy. Go with (C).

I'm pretty sure I remember having some discussions about the Bit8 interface
somewhere. Hmm... Yes. thoughts/fble.lib.bits.txt. Now I remember why I got
stuck here before.

Here's a random thought: instead of Byte@, why not use Int@? Read we just say
reads a single byte, with value in range [0, 256). Write truncates to 8 bits.
Or, similarly, why not just have a list of bits? It's a much nicer, more
general interface. No need to restrict ourselves to 8 bits in the type.

I like the idea of returning Int@. I see no real downside to using Int@
instead of a Byte@ type. Except maybe it's not natural for md5 sum to operate
on Int@.

From a performance point of view, I don't see any benefit of using Bit8@ over
Int@. Yeah. Let's kick start IO by replacing all uses of Byte@ with Int@.
A single standard integer type is nice. No real benefit to having different
width limited integer types. If we want modulo arithmetic or bitwise, we can
just define different operations on Int@.

---

I started changing the exit code to Int@ instead of Bool@, but I don't really
see the point of that much generality to start. I only use pass/fail. Let's
keep it like that for now then.

Next I went to try changing stdin to be M@<Maybe@<Int@>>. Before we do that,
though, we'll want a way to convert Int@ to Char@. Maybe define
/Char/Ascii% with Ord and Chr functions?

Next is about how best to organize the code. I want:

* M@ parameterized monad.
* Stdio@<M@> with the core input.
* Some modules that take Stdio@<M@> core input and define top level functions
  for users to use, like GetLine, Puts, etc.
* Functions implemented that reference those top level functions. 

Or... all everything top level parameterized by Stdio@<M@>?

---

I want main functions to be parameterized by M and Stdio@<M@> interfaces. That
way they can be composed in pure settings. That means the modules we write are
either functions of M and Stdio@<M@>, or they return functions of M and
Stdio@<M@>.

My worry is, if they are functions, we might often apply the same function to
the same M and Stdio@<M@> instance. I'm not worried about the type parameter
M@, because that gets erased. But passing around the Stdio@<M@> instance is a
potentially problem if it means allocating a bunch of copies of function
values.

Except, function values are cheap, right? So why worry?

Anyway, from the coding point of view, the question is: do we want a module to
be a function that returns a bunch of values, or a bunch of function values?

I feel like this is the first time I've tried to write library functions (like
GetLine) that depend on a monad instance. Thus far everything has been
restricted to small helper functions in main files.

So, instead of:

   Unit@ _ <- m.do(stdio.out(Strs[...]));

We want either:

   % Stdio = /Core/Stdio%(m, stdio);
   Unit@ _ <- m.do(Stdio.Puts(Strs[...]));

Or:
   Unit@ _ <- m.do(Stdio.Puts(m, stdio, Strs[...]));

But in the first one, if we end up calling the function a lot, we don't want
to re-invoke /Core/Stdio% so often.

Which suggests what we really want is to factor out the m, stdio arguments
into static variables to whatever function we are defining.
   
Let me try that route and see how it goes, because explicitly passing m, stdio
around everywhere doesn't sound like much fun to me.

Strawman:
* We have a type parameterized module to define Stdio@ interface and helper
  types? No, that doesn't work nicely. Because you would have to write things
  like:
   <<@>@ M@> { 
      % Stdio = /Core/Stdio%<M@>;
      (Monad@<M@> m, Stdio.Stdio@ stdio, ...)

Strawman:
1. Have a module that defines Stdio@ interface types. Each type is
  parameterized by M@ separately.
2. Have a module that is a function: given instance of Stdio@, returns a bunch
  of helper functions for GetLine, Puts, etc.
3. Users are expected to be written as modules that are given instances of
   Stdio@, instantiate (2) at the top level.

That suggests the signature we want for Main@ is:

<<@>@ M@>(Monad@<M@>, Stdio@<M@>)(List@<String@> args) { M@<Bool@>; }

That makes some sense to me. What names are we going to use for these modules?

* /Core/Monad% defines Monad@ type
* /Core/Stdio% defines Stdio@ and helper types.
  - Maybe we make Stdio@ an abstract type, to force all interaction to happen
    via helper functions?
* /Core/Stdio/... to define helper functions as desired.

The initial helper functions I expect to want:
* Stdio, Stdin, Stdout
* Read, Write
* GetChar, GetLine
* PutChar, PutStr
* PutLine,

For now, put them all in one module called /Core/Stdio/Stdio%?

In theory we can do incremental migration to this. Start with ... well, it's
not perfect. GetLine implicitly takes from stdin? How about just 'In', 'Out',
and 'Err', which we can factor away later.
