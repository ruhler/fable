Snake: An engine for a simple snake game.

You have a snake in a 2D grid of cells. The goal is to direct the snake
towards food to make it grow bigger and bigger, and to avoid having the
snake eat itself.

Parameter WIDTH:
  A non-negative integer describing the number of columns in the grid.

Parameter HEIGHT:
  A non-negative integer describing the number of rows in the grid.

Parameter Random Number Generator:
  A potentially unbounded sequence of random integers in a specified range.
  Used to determine where new food items are placed in the grid.

Input:
  A sequence of input actions. An input action is one of:
    UP - to change the snake's direction to up
    DOWN - to change the snake's direction to down
    LEFT - to change the snake's direction to left
    RIGHT - to change the snake's direction to right
    ADVANCE - to advance the snake one unit of time

State:
  The position of the snake.
    This can be described using a sequence of coordinates within the grid. The
    length of the sequence is the length of the snake. The coordinates
    describe the location each body part of the snake from head to tail. A
    subsequent body part will be adjescent on the grid to the immediately
    preceeding body part in the sequence.

  The position of the next item of food.
    This is a coordinate in the grid.

  The state of the snake. One of:
    GOING_LEFT
    GOING_RIGHT
    GOING_UP
    GOING_DOWN
    DEAD
    NEW_BORN

  The current score. This is a non-negative integer that is a function of the
  length of the snake.

Observing State:
  There are two ways to observe the state: Snapshot and Delta.

  Snapshot: Methods are provided to access internal state described above
  using various views. These access a snapshot of the current state.

  Delta: A stream of state updates emmitted as they occur.
