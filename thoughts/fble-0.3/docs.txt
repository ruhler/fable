Fble 0.3 Miscellaneous Docs Topics
==================================

Be able to write doc comments for extern values and types as well as
functions?

Let's find some concrete examples.

Extern: fble-value.h FbleGenericTypeValue.

/**
 * FbleValue instance for types.
 *
 * Used as an instance of an fble type for those types that don't need any
 * extra information at runtime.
 */
extern FbleValue* FbleGenericTypeValue;

What do we want to turn it into?

There are 4 pieces of information:
* name
* brief
* type
* description

Call it @value.

The only real question is how we want to pass the type. Probably as an
argument, but that might make brief slightly annoying. For example:

/**
 * @value[FbleGenericTypeValue][FbleValue*] FbleValue instance for types.
 *  Used as an instance of an fble type for those types that don't need any
 *  extra information at runtime.
 */
extern FbleValue* FbleGenericTypeValue;

/**
 * @value[FbleGenericTypeValue] FbleValue instance for types.
 *  Used as an instance of an fble type for those types that don't need any
 *  extra information at runtime.
 *  
 *  @type FbleValue*
 */
extern FbleValue* FbleGenericTypeValue;

/**
 * @value[FbleValue*][FbleGenericTypeValue] FbleValue instance for types.
 *  Used as an instance of an fble type for those types that don't need any
 *  extra information at runtime.
 */
extern FbleValue* FbleGenericTypeValue;

/**
 * @value[FbleGenericTypeValue] FbleValue instance for types.
 * @[FbleValue*]
 *  Used as an instance of an fble type for those types that don't need any
 *  extra information at runtime.
 */
extern FbleValue* FbleGenericTypeValue;

Honestly, I think @value[type][name][brief][description] makes sense. Except
that doesn't work as well with dcget.

Otherwise, @value[name][brief][description], where description contains @type
tag is okay I guess. Consistent with function. Except what does it mean of
@type isn't provided? Dunno. Anyway, let's give that a try to start.

We want to generate a man page and run dc check. Should be straight forward.

Can we require @type in dc check? That would be nice. We can probably do that.
