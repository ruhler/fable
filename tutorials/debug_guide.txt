Fble Debugging Guide
====================
Fble has some limited support for debugging. This document explains tips and
tricks for making the most of the currently available debug support.

* Compile your code.
  There is debug support for compiled fble code generated using the aarch64
  target. There is not currently debug support for compiled fble generated
  using the c target nor for interpreted fble code. Compile your code using
  the aarch64 target to access that debug support.

* To print an Int@ variable value in gdb:
  print FbleIntValueAccess(foo)

* To print a String@ variable value in gdb:
  print FbleStringValueAccess(foo)

* To access a struct field:
  print FbleStructValueAccess(foo, tag)

* To set a breakpoint that will trigger on runtime error:
  break fprintf

* For printf like debugging.
  Define an unused String@ variable in your fble source code. Run your code in
  the debugger, break at the line after the String@ variable is defined, and use 
  print FbleStringValueAccess(string_var) to display the value of the string.

  To prevent the string value from being truncated by gdb, first issue:
      set print elements 0
