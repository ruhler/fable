* Implement operator<< or pretty printer for Expr.
* Once everything is up to snuff, delete androcles.
* Document the language and sequential interpretation.
* Is it legal to have undefined values?
  For example:
  
   MaybeInt x = Nothing;
   Int v = x.value;
   return case (x) {
     Just: v;
     Nothing: 3;
   };

   Is this legal, or does the x.value have to occur inside the case branch?
   Or is it all undefined?
