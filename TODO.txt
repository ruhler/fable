* [modules]
 - Add 'type' field to FbleLoadedModule.
   Typecheck it and compare to value type in typecheck if available.
 - Split FbleCompile into FbleCompileProgram and FbleCompileModule.
 - Split FbleLoad into FbleLoadProgram and FbleLoadModule.
 - Add support for loading .fble.@ files.
   And presumably some way to test this and something about it in the language
   spec?

* [graphics]
 - Figure out what to do about my Triangle drawing implementation now that we
   can draw triangles directly.

* [pinball] 
 - Improve performance somehow.
 - Give width to paddle.
 - Fix issue with ball not hitting end points of edges.
 - Test and fix issue with ball getting stuck bouncing between two close
   bumpers.

 - Design a relatively complete traditional pinball play field I can use to
   exercise everything of what I expect I may want to support.
 - Figure out how to deal with imprecision in test.
 - Change paddle velocity to increase gradually instead of instantly?

* [lib] Move more value conversion functions to separate object files.
 - Color, IO, etc.

* [lang] Clean up support for abstract types.
 - Rename FBLE_POLY_APPLY_EXPR to FBLE_MISC_TYPE_APPLY_EXPR?
 - Add more tests.
   Test that you can't access an abstract value with the wrong token type.
   Test use of non-token type to access an abstract value?
   Test that name of token type is a type name.
   Test what happens if a value is passed in <...> instead of a type.
   Test error that would cause a raw abstract type to be printed.
   Test you can only create abstract types using token types, not arbitrary
   types. In particular, not arbitrary abstract variable types.
   A test for application to non-data type.
   Test more complex illegal casts.

   For example, (Unit@) { Unit@; }(xxx);
 - Try turning Int@ into an abstract type.

* [debugger] Improve support for printing variables
 - Add VarDebugInfo for function static variables.
 - Emit lexical scopes where appropriate.

* Remove function bind syntax again, now that we no longer use it?
  On the one hand, it seems a shame to have a syntactic sugar that I don't
  currently use for anything. On the other hand, I must have had good reason
  to add it back for fblf.

* [/Graphics] Debug clipping artifacts
  Looks like precision gets off some times for clipping, with bits of sky
  showing through the ground. Figure out what's up, right a test and fix it.
    Try a triangle with points (-20, -6, -30), (-20, -6, 30), (20, -6, -30).
    The lower left corner gets clipped wrong? Focus 10, camera at (1,0,0).

  The issue:
  1. Clip X axis, so that X point is right on the edge, but just outside.
  2. Clip Y axis, so that Y point is right on the edge, but just outside.
  But rounding Y coord just outside rounds X coord just inside.

  In this example, if we clip Y first, we don't have a problem, because then
  we end up clipping towards a point outside both x and y. Otherwise we end up
  clipping towards a point outside y but inside x.
  
  Not sure what the solution is though.

* [/Graphics] Add a left to right scan version of Triangles and pick that if
  the distance is shorter than bottom to top.

* Implement fannkuchredux benchmark?
  Permutation order looks like:
    0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n
    all subpermutations of length n-1
    1, 2, 3, ..., n, 0
    all subpermutations ...
    2, 3, 4, ..., 0, 1
    etc.
    In other words, keep track of current length, rotate the first n elements.
* Implement IEEE floating point?
* Implement a regular expression engine?

* Can we make tail calls from compiled to compiled code more efficient?
 - Seems like, if we know we are calling into compiled code, we could avoid
   resetting the stack frame on tail call and it would be much more efficient?

* Consider running some of the tests under valgrind?
 - To catch memory issues that could otherwise go undetected?

* Implement md5 in Hwdg
 -  Give separate Tests modules for each submodule.
 -  Move Adder module to a Designs subdirectory.
 -  Figure out a nicer API for Adder.
 -  Add tests for the Adder module.

* Implement support for packed data values.
 - Change the compiler to allocate FbleDataTypeValue when appropriate.
 - Pass type to struct and union construction and access functions.
 - Implement packing for struct and union values.
* Avoid calling 'FbleRelease' in those cases where the compiler can tell
  statically that a value will be packed?

* Improve performance with profiling enabled?
 - Now that we removed the optimization for detecting duplicate call entries
   in the stack?
 - see thoughts/fble.profile.txt

* Fix missing dependency of generation of build.ninja on new spec tests.
* Fix issue with build when removing a spec test.

* Investigate why fork-race test generates so many functions with the same
  name? Is there a bug here somewhere? Shouldn't profile block names be
unique?

* For loaded submodules, should the module profile block be the module file or
  the place where it was imported from?
 - Seems like it should be the module file, because it could be imported from
   multiple places?

* Try to reduce size of generated assembly?
 - Factor out slow paths for profiling and returning abort?
 - Generate a sparse pc jump table?
 - Avoid emitting unused labels?

* Move prototype for FbleLoadCompiled to a better place?

* Change FbleProfile functions to accept NULL, and clean up code to take
  advantage of that where it makes sense?

* Use some way other than NULL to disable profiling?
 - To encourage all the apps to support optional profiling, including things
   like fble-md5 and fble-app?
 - Check we are passing meaningful block ids to FbleNewInputPortValue and
   FbleNewOutputPortValue in all cases.

* Add option for passing .so files to FbleMain.
* Consider reorganizing 'langs' directory?
 - Separate tests from specification?

* Print full stack trace on abort instead of just the top stack trace?
* Optimize Sat simplification to avoid lots of repeated traversals?

* Run fble-test-compile-error tests in compilation mode?

* Consider having separate CALL_INSTR and TAIL_CALL_INSTR.
  Their implementations may be different enough now to warrant it?

* Consider changing RELEASE_INSTR to take a vector of args to release?
  - Just to speed up interpreted code for the case where we are freeing a
    bunch of values in a row before returning or tail calling.

* Figure out how to get the profiling block I want around exec bindings?
 - I think the way it's setup, either we'll get no block in some cases, or
   double blocks in some cases. Is it really that important to fix?
 - Maybe add a test case at least to show the problem in ProfileTests.fble?

* Remove dependence of interpret.c and generated code on value.h.
  Making value functions public as necessary to support this.
  - Need public access to FbleFuncValue.statics.
  - Need FbleStrictValue. Or should this be done inside the value functions?
  - Use FbleStructValueAccess for generated code.
  - Use FbleNewStructValue for interpret.c somehow.
  and so on...

* Change FbleLink to use FbleExecutable directly instead of FbleCode?
 - Does this mean making a copy of the FbleExecutableProgram? That's tedious.

* [compilation] Switch over entirely to compilation use case?
 - Remove interpreter entirely? Any significant downside?
 - We could always write a wrapper script that calls the compiler, for
   example, to give the same user experience as the interpreter currently
   gives us.
 - Note: currently the interpreter case is my answer for how to run on
   architectures other than aarch64.

* [compilation] Cleanup API between execute/value/interpret/generated code.
 - Can I cleanup/break the dependency cycle between execute.h and value.h?
 - Should definition of FbleThread* be private to execute.c?
* [compilation] Make public headers available for compiled code to use so we don't have to
  give direct access to internal header files.
* [compilation] Add support for .fble.@ files and modular compilation.

* [cleanup] For things like FbleValueAddRef, is it okay if dst is NULL?
 - It would be convenient for constructing things in case of error.
 - I'm not sure if there's any performance implications.
 - It would be nice to specify explicitly and be consistent with this kind of
   thing.
* [cleanup] Consistently document ownership of args to C functions?
 Borrowed: no transfer of ownership.
 Consumed: ownership transferred from caller to callee.
 Outlives: caller responsible for keeping alive as long as returned result is.

* [build] Decide whether individual test failures should fail to build or not.
  If they should fail to build, then tools/tests.tcl could be simplified?
 - building with -k 0 and grepping for FAILED is a decent way to see the list
   of all current failures.

* [tests] Any way to improve memory growth tests?
 It feels wrong to me to have to do a full gc for the tests to pass. It feels
 too specific to the implementation of garbage collection. Anything we can do?
* [tests] Add coverage for tagged_type and tagged_expr parse destructors
 - if only I could figure out how to exercise them.

* [/*%] Follow style guide in fble.txt
  In particular, union field names should be lowercase: just, true, false, not
  Just, True, False.
* [/*%] Clean up fble library
 - Separate modules as appropriate to reduce false dependencies.
 - Document all functions.
 - Add tests for full code coverage of all functions.
 - Rename Str to String? Or to S?
 - Only support Int@ officially, not IntP@ and IntS@ too?
 - Consider pulling ForEach and Map out into their own class?
* [/App%] Change App% back to drawing over the previous screen?
 - It can figure out how to double buffer appropriately on the implementation
   side, for example by drawing the last two updates to the buffer.
 - Because presumably, if not much has changed, that can be much more
   efficient? And if a lot has changed, we can optimize 'Over' to throw away
   the previous frame entirely if you start with a blank screen?

   Maybe more accurate is, if your point of view isn't changing, delta is
   better. If your point of view is changing, you probably have to redraw
   everything regardless and it would be nice to avoid drawing a bunch of
   stuff and then covering it up right away.
* [/Int%] Add test coverage for the Int routines.
* [/Fble/Test%] Clean up fble test framework
 - Use AssertEquals for more of the tests.
 - Add an AssertLt or similar methods? Or generalize AssertEquals?
 - Properly test the test infra.
* [/GameOfLife%] Switch to a target 60 FPS?
* [/Hwdg%] Improve the API for describing a bunch of gates with modules.
* [/Hwdg%] Add test case for nondeterministic/conflicting gates case.
* [/Map%] Add tests for balancing of /Map%?
* [/Sat%] Optimize the solver.
* [/Sat%] Implement dimacs cnf parser.
* [/Snake%] Switch to a target 60 FPS?
* [/Snake%] Test and fix bug when snake eats its tail.
* [/Snake%] Ignore moves that aren't orthogonal to current snake direction.
* [/Snake%] Keep track of and report score.
* [/Snake%] Figure out why the background box gets lost some times.

* [libfble] Can fble-stdio check that the function has the right type?

* [lang] Add some way to catch or recover from errors at runtime?
* [lang] Clarify in spec: is it okay to retain a local variable until a function
  exits, even if that means retaining it longer than its lexical scope?
* [lang] Clarify spec on when (compile vs runtime) vacuous value error should be
  reported.
* [lang] Revisit notion of packages and public/private access to modules.
* [lang] Document the runtime memory model,
  - Including that tail recursive functions should not smash the stack.
* [lang] Document and test that put ports don't retain link values.

* [typecheck] Change FbleFuncValueTc scope to be FbleTcV? Isn't that more natural?
* [typecheck] Be more consistent in FbleTc about use of vector versus FbleTc*[].
* [typecheck] We don't get a warning about an unused self recursive function.
  More generally, we don't get warnings about variables that are referenced
  only by unused variables.
* [typecheck] Better error messages on types that have the same name but different values?
* [typecheck] Quote funny names in types. For example, the field ',' should have
  quotes in type error messages.
* [typecheck] Better error message for importing something from a module that
  is not defined in the module?
* [typecheck] Test and fix error message for type of anonymous type let values.
 - The type should be the computed type for the value, not the introduced
   abstract type?
* [typecheck] Figure out why Normal is called so often
 - See if we can fix that to reduce the now annoyingly long compile times.
 - Profiling said its all in TypeEquals. Maybe something pathological?
* [typecheck] Improve type error in case of this?
  <@ T@>{ Maybe@<T@>; } Nothing = <@ T@> { Maybe@<T@>(nothing: Unit@()); };
  True.?(true: Nothing<Bool@>, false: True);

  We get: expected type <@ T@> { Maybe@<T@>; }<Bool@>
  Should we instead get: expected type Maybe@<Bool@>? 
* [typecheck] Clean up memory management code somehow?
  It's tough to keep track of what variables are alive when and need to be
  freed where. Is there some convention we can come up with to make it much
  more obvious what is live when and who is responsible for freeing something?

* [eval] Clean up how we track io activity?
  See thoughts/fble.threads.txt
* [eval] Thread execution should be at least somewhat fair.
  In the current implementation, in theory, a long running non-IO computation
  could cause IO threads to get blocked. That's certainly against the spirit
  of the spec, but I don't have a clear definition for how things ought to
  behave or a decent way to test that. Figure out something better here.
* [eval] Make child thread execution fair.
  Children should be time multiplexed, where priority is assigned based on how
  far down the family tree the child belongs. The amount of time a family gets
  to spend evaluating should be independent of the number of children in the
  family.

* [profile] Check if it's okay to add new blocks to a profile in progress.
 - either way, document that clearly.

* [debugger] Implement an fble debugger?
  see thoughts/fble.debugger.txt

* [release] Write man pages for fble and friends?
