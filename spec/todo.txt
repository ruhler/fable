* For each part of the syntax, have a section with explicit bulleted (And
  labelled) points for what is required for that syntactic item to be 'well
  formed' (where by well formed, I mean well formed and well typed and all
  that goodness).

* Is it an error if there is an error in unreachable code?
  Answer should probably be yes, and I should make this explicit.
