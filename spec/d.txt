Brainstorm for 'D', a language on top of Calvisus designed for humans to
write, with a bunch of descriptive features.

* Ability to split source code across files.
* Namespace support.
   - I should be able to import a module, bringing in all its declarations
     under a name qualifier of my choice.
* Support for internal/private functions.
