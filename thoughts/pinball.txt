Pinball Game
============

There are so many different games we could redo as a pinball game. For
example:
* skiball
* bowling
* breakout
* space invaders
* soccer
* platformer, like mario brothers or celeste
* Air hockey.

Initial proposal:
* Have a half court with sloping sides and paddles with a single object at the
  top of the screen that goes back and forth left and right in a fixed
  pattern. You have a score multiplier. Hit the object, you score the number
  of points on the score multiplier and double the score multiplier. Hit the
  ceiling you reset the score multiplier to 1. The game ends when the ball
  drops down the drain.

  Ideally we can print a score on the screen and keep track of high score and
  all that stuff. No fancy graphics required.

Current challenge:
* With just a ball and fixed edges, it's going way too slow. Averaging 4
  frames per second. We want to get it up to 60 frames per second. So let's do
  some profiling to figure out what's up.

Without looking at profiles yet, what I expect is:
* Maybe collision detection is expensive, given the performance seems tied
  directly to the number of edges in the screen. Maybe we can add a fast path
  cutout?
