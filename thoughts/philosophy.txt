* You should be able to reason about your program in terms of sequential
  execution.

* Abstractions and other mechanisms to facilitate describing programs should
  have zero runtime cost.

  For example, the order you declare variables shouldn't matter. If you wrap
  an expression with a function, that should not change the behavior (as it
  would, for example, in a strict functional language). Any number of finite
  inlining of functions should not change the behavior of the program.

  The implementation should not be limited by how you sequentially reason
  about your program.
