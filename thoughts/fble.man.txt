## What to do about man pages?

In my ideal world, we have man pages for all of the installed binaries and
public library functions. In a practical world, there are some questions:
* Should each library function have its own man page, or should we group them
  together? If we group them together, what should the groupings be?
* How do we generate the man pages?
 - By hand, and check them in?
 - Using some tool?
* How do we deal with duplicate information in man pages, --help usage
  messages, and function doc comments in header files?
