Syntax Reference
----------------

* A sequence of files are concatenated together and parsed as block structured
  text.
* Block structured text is a sequence of blank line delimited blocks.
* A block is either a block command or implicit block text.
* Implicit block text is inline structured text up to the next blank line.
* A block command starts with '@' in the first column, followed by a command
  name, followed by:
  - Zero or more inline arguments.
  - An optional same line argument.
  - An optional next line argument.
  - An optional continuation.
  - An optional final argument.
* An inline argument is inline structured text in square brackets.
* A same line argument is inline structured text between a single space
  character and the end of the line.
* A next line argument is when the next line starts with a single space
  indent. The following lines that maintain that single space indent are
  parsed as block structured text with the single space indent removed.
* A continuation is when the following line starts with '@' without a
  following command name. Everything allowed after a block command name is
  allowed after a continuation.
* A final argument is when the next line is '@@'. The following unindented
  text is parsed as block structured text.
* Inline structured text is a sequence of inlines.
* An inline is either an inline command or plain text.
* Inline command is '@' followed by a command name followed by zero or more
  inline arguments.
* Plain text is everything else not inline text.
* \\, \[, \], and \@ are escape sequences for \, [, ], and @.
* A command name is one or more characters from [a-zA-Z0-9_].

Details:
* Lines that are blank or only contain spaces do not interrupt indented text,
  even if they have fewer spaces than the current indent level.

Questions:
* Can you have an empty continuation? For example:
  @foo
  @
  @ hello
* Can you have unescaped nested [ ] in plain text?
