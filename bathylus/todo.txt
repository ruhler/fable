* Test adder4.
* Document the language and sequential interpretation.
* Is it legal to have undefined values?
  For example:
  
   MaybeInt x = Nothing;
   Int v = x.value;
   return case (x) {
     Just: v;
     Nothing: 3;
   };

   Is this legal, or does the x.value have to occur inside the case branch?
   Or is it all undefined?

   I think it should be legal, and it should be legal to pass undefined values
   to functions, and it should be legal for functions to return undefined
   values, even if they aren't passed undefined values. The thing that
   shouldn't be allowed is relying on undefined behavior as the final result
   of the main function.

* Once everything is up to snuff, delete androcles.
