* Re-organize function.h,cc into
  Private: Expr_, VarDecl, FunctionDecl
  Public: Expr, Alt, Function, FunctionBuilder, FunctionEnv

  Such that Private does not depend on Public in any way.

* Use 'function' everywhere, not 'func'

* Get tests passing.

* Implement Value operator<< for test purposes.
* Implement Expr operator<< for test purposes.
* Implement and test Expr equality operators.
* Uncomment that CHECK that's commented out in function.cc
* Implement parser (steal from what I have and nuke circuit, truth_table)
* Write main interpreter executable
