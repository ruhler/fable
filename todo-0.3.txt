Fble 0.3 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.3 release.

* Fix failing memory tests on windows laptop

* move heap.c contents to type.c, given it's only used for types now and
  to avoid confusion otherwise? Or at least rename type_heap.c?

Doc Comments
* dccheck require @type in @value content?
* Add support for @union and @enum doc comments?
* Add support for abstract typedef struct doc comments?
* Would be nice to have SEE ALSO section for library man pages.
* Figure out how to get rid of extra space before '}' in man page struct
  synopsis.

* Fbld Markdown Backend
 - Reflow paragraphs to 80 columns.
 - How to support labels in markdown?
 - etc.

* write tutorials for C api.
* Factor out common code for @FbleVersion (@BuildStamp)

* Consider syntax highlighting of the syntax specification in fble.fbld.
* Add way to do inline code syntax highlighting in fbld?

* Improve vim syntax highlighting of {} blocks in fbld
 - For example, it shouldn't highlight in the case of: @l[{]@hi@l[}].

* Improve fbld syntax highlighting of {} blocks in fbld
 - For example, don't highlight @degralder in @l{ruhler@degralder.com}.
* fbld how to start a paragraph with inline text after a literal @code[...] @
  block? Adding a space at the start of the line makes it become part of the
  @code block.

* Add a tutorial for writing unit tests?
* Write an App tutorial.
* Improve exercises for Unions and Functions tutorials, and others.

Usage docs
* Come up with a better story for building and integrating usage help text?
* Add usage generated help text to fble derived programs?
 graphics, md5, pinball, invaders, and sat?

* Proper support for unicode characters in /Core/Char%.

* Fbld 'end of input' error should point to last character of file, not '???'

* There's no way to do user defined ifneq in fbld?
  Because all the arguments are evaluated. That's annoying?

* Finalize release:
 - record release date in release notes.
