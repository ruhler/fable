Format
======

A format for describing documents in a more precise manner than asciidoc.
It is a line-based format, with the following kinds of lines. Whitespace at
the beginning of the lines is ignored.

@title <text>
  Gives the title of the document. There must be exactly one title for a
  document.

@author <text>
  Describes an author of the document.

@date <text>
  Describes the dat of the document.

@section <text>
  Indicates the start of a new subsection. The text is the title of the
  section. The following lines between this line and a matching @end line
  belong to the subsection.

@example
  Indicates the start of an example block. The subsequent lines of text are
  interpreted as the contents of the example, until an @end line is
  encountered.

@end 
  Indicates the end of a block.

@list[<type>]
  Indicates the start of a list. The type is 'numbered' to indicate a numbered
  list, 'bulleted' to indicate a list with bullets.
  The next lines contain the contents of the list, where each item of the list
  is identified with either a  @li or @bi entry. The list ends with an @end.

@li <text>
  A list item that takes a single line. The text has the contents of the item.
  This must occur inside a @list block.

@bi
  A list item that is a block. The text following this line up to the
  cooresponding @end line contains the contents. This must occur inside a
  @list block.

<text>
  A sentence.

<blank line>
  When between sentices, a blank line indicates a paragraph break.

TODO:
* How to support the 'Syntax: ...' blocks in the calvisus spec?
  Maybe make it possible to define custom syntax for stuff?
* Is there a difference in an example or other kind of block attached to a
  paragraph versus separated from the previous paragraph? I feel like there
  are clear cases where I want to attach it to the previous paragraph.
* For examples, how is whitespace at the start of the line expressed?
* How to reference a numbered list item?
* Can we have other domain specific entries?
  For example, all the 'the following is required' list entries may be better
  served as a custom entry that can be changed later on in a uniform way
  rather than copying the formatting of it everywhere. This is like the
  'Syntax:...' blocks.
* How can I say: number this list as a continuation of the previous list?
