Fble 0.3 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.3 release.

* Fix failing memory tests on windows laptop

* Improve exercises for Unions and Functions tutorials, and others.

Usage docs
* Come up with a better story for building and integrating usage help text?
* Add usage generated help text to fble derived programs?
 graphics, md5, pinball, invaders, and sat?

* There's no way to do user defined ifneq in fbld?
  Because all the arguments are evaluated. That's annoying?

* Finalize release:
 - Add anything missing since last update.
 - record release date in release notes.
