Fble 0.6 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.6 release.

* Optimize C and interpreter backends like we did aarch64?
  By inlining logic to access fble values instead of calling library
  functions.

* Make programs run twice as fast.

* Fix potential GC gen overflow?
 - See thoughts/fble-0.3/stack_alloc.txt for details.
 - See thoughts/fble-0.5/gc.txt for more thoughts.
