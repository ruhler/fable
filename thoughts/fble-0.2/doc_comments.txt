Doc Comments
============
There are a few remaining todo items around improvements to doc comments
before making the release. Discussing those here.

---

* convert lib/*, bin/*, test/*, etc. code to fbld doc comments.

This is going to be a lot of work. Let's set up dccheck on bin/* and test/* to
start. Make some progress on conversions. But otherwise don't worry about
finishing this. It should be more an incremental progress thing.

Hint for checking doc comments:
* ninja */*.dc -k0
* Remember to make the fixes in the original .c file, not the generated .fbld
  file.

---

* How to handle @file doc comments on header files?
  - Should we write documentation for them somewhere?

The desired format seems obvious:
  @file[filename][description]

For dc_check, it would be easy. Add @file to the list of doc comments
extracted and define @file.

For include files? We don't use them in man pages. We wouldn't end up
extracting them. Unless I want to add dc_check for all the include files, I
wouldn't catch errors there. Do I want to add dc_check for all the include
files? Sure. There aren't too many. We can make this the next change.

---

* Document how to write doc comments somewhere.

Should be straight forward. fbld/doc_comments.fbld, or fbld/DocComments.fbld
should be a good place to write it. We can add it to www next to fbld.html.
