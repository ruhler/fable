Fble 0.4 Release
================
What's the plan?

Big categories of work right now are:
* Performance
 - Better data value packing.
 - Function call inlining.
* Modular compilation
* Debugger
* Fbld in C.
* Fbld core library revision.
* Fble standard library.
* New apps.

My vote:
1. Start with fbld in C. That should give some performance baseline and also
improve build times a bunch.

Then go from there, whatever I feel like. We have a pretty solid list of
options for things to work on. There's more than enough here for a release.
What's nice is these big things are mostly orthogonal.

Tracking my current stack of work:

Improve performance.
=> Improve profiling.
=> Write an http server in fble.
=> Improve OS IO handling in fble.
=> Implement proper modular compilation support.

The content for the release is shaping up nicely. I think we can declare the
scope of release clearly now:
* [fbld] fbld in C
* [lang] modular compilation
* [lib] improved OS IO handling
* [lib] TCP sockets library
* [app] network test protocols
* [app] experimental profile viewer

We'll punt the following to a later release:
* Performance improvements
* Debugger
* Fbld core library revision

Cool. So, some more explanation to do to see how far I want to go with the
experimental profile viewer. The rest is cleanup and burndown.

Question: do I want to re-write profiling for this release? How about: give it
a try. If it turns out to be too difficult, we can punt to next release. Try
enough to get decent enough experience writing fble for the experimental
profile viewer. That's the most important part: using the language and
learning from that experience.
