Fble Doxygen
============
So I've decided to try using doxygen for fable. See thoughts/fble.man.txt and
thoughts/fble.docs.txt for context.

This discussion is to track cleanup work on the use of doxygen.

Things that need to be done:
* Convert all doc comments over to doxygen.
* Enable warnings as errors once everything is converted.
* Fix dependency tracking.
* Add man pages to be installed.
* Figure out how to use relative include path instead of absolute in man page
  name.
* Figure out how to add proper #include to SYNOPSIS of generated man pages.
* Come up with a doc comment style guide.
 - style for brief?
 - style for @param description?
 - style for @returns description?
