Fble CMake
==========
Goal: see if we can uses CMake to build Fble packages, including the compiler
and fble program packages.

The motivation is: if we can build things with cmake, then it should be more
portable, handle configuration and package dependencies automatically, and
make it easy to create distributable packages.
