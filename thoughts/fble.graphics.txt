Fble Graphics Library
=====================
I've gotten started on an fble 3d graphics library. This is an application
to drive development of language, and a good performance benchmark.

What we have so far:
* I can draw triangles in perspective.

What's next:
* There is a bug in the implementation of clipping that needs to be fixed.
* Support for hidden surface removal.
* Support for shadows and lighting.

My idea for shadows and lighting is to clip a scene from the point of view of
the light, get back the clipped scene in the original 3D coordinate system,
then draw that from the point of view of the camera on top of the non-lit
scene. That depends on hidden surface removal being implemented as part of the
clipping.

I don't have any great ideas yet for how to fix the clipping glitch. Maybe
something about how I can compute the (x,y) slope of a projected line given
the (x,y,z) slope the 3D line. So as long as I can find a point of the line
inside the clip region in 2D space, I could walk along the slope to find where
it intersects the clip region. That doesn't help with being able to clip in 3D
though.

Idea for clipping: just round all results away from 0. Is that enough? Ideally
we want to round all results away from any point inside the clip region. I
guess you can specify clip regions that don't have the point (0, 0) at the
center. That's annoying. Otherwise I think it should be fine to always round
away from 0. Something worth trying as a hack anyway.
