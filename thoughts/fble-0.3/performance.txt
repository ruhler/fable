Performance
===========
Goal for fble-0.3 is to make fble programs run twice as fast.

Take fbld implementation for example, because that seems to go absurdly slow
compared to what I would expect if I coded the same thing in C code.

Let's start with a simpler example and see if we can really break down where
the time is going. Because presumably making a simple program run twice as
fast is easier than making a complex program, and anything we do to improve
performance we expect to work on the simple program too.

Starting with fble-cat, read from 'yes' and writing to /dev/null.

Let's aim for 60 seconds of runtime.

time yes | head -n 500000 | ./out/pkgs/core/fble-cat > /dev/null
real    1m19.413s
user    1m7.136s
sys     0m3.723s

time yes | head -n 500000 | cat > /dev/null  
real    0m0.104s
user    0m0.027s
sys     0m0.046s

That's what I'm talking about. fble is 1000x slower than I would like.
