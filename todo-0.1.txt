Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

* Pick a working example for fble-disassemble usage info.
  Maybe for fble-compile and fble-deps too.

* double check if we set MANDIR something or other, it picks up the fble man
  pages.

* Add build stamp to man 'source' field?

* Proofread generated html documentation.
 - Including language specs, readme, release notes, and tutorials.

* Run through the tutorials to make sure they work as described.

* Make the official release.

* Tag the git commit of the release.

* Bump the version number.
