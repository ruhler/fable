* Organize test cases better somehow.
* Add a static pass to type check an environment.
* Always return nice error messages to the user, don't just fail an assertion.
* Be able to parse from a string as well as a file.
  - Then add a '-e' option to fblc to specify an arbitrary expression to
    evaluate in the context of the given program.
* Be able to parse from a list of files instead of just one?
  This will help for tests or other programs that share some common functions.
* Implement support for processes.
* Ditch the name 'calvisus' and stick with 'fblc'?
* Write a man page for fblc?
