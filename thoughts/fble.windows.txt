Using Fble on Windows
=====================
Via cygwin.

1. Install ninja.
Easy enough.

2. Install bison.
Easy enough.

3. Compiler warning in SizeofSanitizedString. Interesting.

  for (const char* p = str; *p != '\0'; p++) {
    size += isalnum(*p) ? 1 : 4;

fble/lib/generate_aarch64.c|1269 col 21| error: array subscript has type ‘char’ [-Werror=char-subscripts]

Looks like we need to be explicit about the conversion from const char to
whatever isalnum expects. What does isalnum expect? Or is the issue that char
is signed? Oh. Internally isalnum is a macro that uses the argument as an
index? So negative is bad.

The header file has a comment saying the warning is intentional in this case.
Looks like I need to cast to unsigned char?

Yeah. That fixes it. Hopefully that works too on linux.

4. We don't have aarch64.
