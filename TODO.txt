* Add support for the proc_tests for fblcbe/fblcbi
 - Will require support for reading external port values
* Test and fix reading/writing a stream of Units
 - which requires some alignment be done.
* Try tictactoe on fblcbe/fblcbi for the fun of it.
 - And see how much faster it is to choose a move on an empty board.
   (Set up some infrastructure for benchmarking?)
* Document spec for binary format much better
 - how do variable ids work?
 - how do port ids work?
 - is there any reason to include types for lets, execs, and links? Given that
   the types can be inferred easily already?
* Implement fblc front end to fblcbi.
* Implement fbld front end to fblcbi.
* Port calc Integer to an fbld module.
* Implement space invaders game in fbld.
