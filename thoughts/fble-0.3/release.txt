Fble 0.3 Release Burndown
=========================
I'm satisfied on performance work for this release. Let's start the release
burndown. What to focus on next?

Potential big things are:
* SatGame
* Rewrite fbld in C.
* Redesign debugger.
* Fbld modularity.
* Modular compilation.

How about we do some fble coding and work on SatGame next?

---

SatGame is in decent enough shape now to start burndown of it. Do I want to
work on anything else big, or start burndown for the release now?

We've updated the language. We've updated the implementation. We've added new
fble programs. I would say modular compilation overlaps a bit with
implementation update, so maybe no need to pull that into this release. fbld
and debugger are separate. Should we try to make some notable progress on
those?

I'd like to start burndown of some things, otherwise the little things are
going to keep adding up. Let's put a little thought into fbld and debugger for
this release, while burning down other things.

---

On further thought, I think we've got enough big features for this release.
Let's burn down and get the release out. Save fbld updates, debugger updates,
modular compilation, etc. for the next release.

Summary of things done so far this release (since f6ead011908897a9a):

Starting from tag fble-0.2:

* Revise tutorials - to simplify and for partial application changes
* Windows msys support for native fble apps
* satgame sample app
* completely revamped memory allocation, do more stack allocation.
  - generational GC
  - for performance improvements
* language support for partial function application.
* Simplify and revamp FbleExecutable API
  - for performance improvements
  - gdb step capability sacrificed

It's worth doing a review of fble lib API changes too, and seeing what more we
want to do before finishing out the fble-0.3 release.

---

I would say all the big things are done now. What's left is going item by item
and either getting it done or pushing it out to a later release. We have 114
lines of todo items to go through.
