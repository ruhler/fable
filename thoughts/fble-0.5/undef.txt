Undefined Values
================
Since we have removed REF_VALUE values from the implementation, it's
worth reconsidering how we treat undefined values.

Today we have two kinds of undefined values:
1. NULL
2. IsRefValue - packed ending in 'b10.

Wouldn't it be great if we could get away with just 'b10 to denote undefined
values? No need to check for both that and NULL?

We can reserve the value 0x2 as the thing to use instead of NULL. All the
checks for IsRefValue would then work to cover that and normal undefined
values.

Sounds good to me in theory. In practice, how can I track down all those
potential NULL cases? Where do they come from?

* undef expression?
* unwinding

Any place else? Do they leak out of the fble value API any place? Should they?
Shouldn't they? The trouble is, NULL seems like a pretty good thing to use for
an error value. It will take some convincing to change that to 0x2 and have
support for checking anything that ends with 'b10 as a potential null.

aarch64 code to check for undefined:
 and x0, x0, 3
 cmp x0, 2
 beq ...

Too bad. That's three instructions instead of just cbz?

Is it worth doing that everywhere instead of having NULL checks here and
there? I'm not sure.

It feels pretty annoying to use FbleUndefinedValue instead of NULL everywhere.
Hmm...

Let me hold off for now until we have more of the code inlined. For now we can
just check for NULL or undefined. Hope for the best. Once we have the double
check everywhere, then it will be a clear improvement to remove that.
