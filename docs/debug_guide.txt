Fble Debugging Guide
====================
Fble has some limited support for debugging. This document explains tips and
tricks for making the most of the currently available debug support.

* Compile your code.
  There is debug support for compiled fble code, not interpreted fble code.
  Compile your code to access that debug support.

* To print an Int@ variable value in gdb:
  print FbleIntValueAccess(foo)

* To print a String@ variable value in gdb:
  print FbleStringValueAccess(foo)

* To access a struct field:
  print FbleStructValueAccess(foo, tag)

* To set a breakpoint that will trigger on runtime error:
  break fprintf
