* Figure out how to test malformed inputs.
* Clean up and document all the functions.
  - Follow style of the Tcl code base? Use prefix FblC?
  - Write constructors for each data type along side the type?
* Add a static pass to type check an environment.
* Always return nice error messages to the user, don't just fail an assertion.
* Be able to parse from a string as well as a file.
  - Then add a '-e' option to fblc to specify an arbitrary expression to
    evaluate in the context of the given program.
