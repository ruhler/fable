Fble 0.5 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.5 release.

* ./pkgs/graphics/Graphics/App.fble:133:41: error: module /Graphics/Usage% not
  found
  From clean build. What's up?

* test/fble-pprof-test.tr depends on build directory.
  Because it hard codes the path to profile.c.
  Don't do this.

* Clean up how build works.
  See thoughts/fble-0.5/build.txt.

* Add spec test that would catch the bug if we failed to GcRealloc a value
  before ref assignment.
  - ref assign to a value which is stack alloc -> gc alloc -> ref.
  - The issue being, after substitution, we would end up with:
    stack -> gc -> stack, and when we return that, we would gc allocate it
    into: gc -> gc -> stack, and that stack value would then be dangling and
    likely to get overwritten.

* fble-pprof doesn't work on windows because read isn't binary by default.
  Add an option to open? Coerce everything to binary, including stdio?

* Figure out how to add an fble-pprof benchmark to fble-benchmark?
  Either via support for pure embedded files, or IO in the benchmarks.

* Write release notes.
 - Add update to treatment of kinds.
