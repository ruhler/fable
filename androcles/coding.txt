Memory Management:
1. The type environement owns all types.
2. The program environment owns all functions.
3. The function owns its result expression.
4. The function has a list of variable declarations,
   Each variable declaration owns its expression.
5. Expressions own their sub-expressions.
   Except in the case of a reference to a variable declaration, where the
   variable declaration owns the sub-expression.
6. Values own their sub-values.
   And if we ever need to use a value in multiple places, we do a deep copy of
   the value.
7. During evaluation, a map is build up of the values computed for each
   variable. This map owns those values.
