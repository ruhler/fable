Fble 0.4 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.4 release.

* Consider removing higher order kinds from the language.
  Make everything either kind @ or %. What would we lose?

* Make programs run twice as fast.

* Improving packing support for data values.
 - Taking advantage of explicit type info to pack and unpack.

* Modular compilation
 - Start using unused code for .@ module value vs type.
 - Split FbleLoad into FbleLoadProgram and FbleLoadModule.
 - Add support for loading .fble.@ files.
 - Test coverage of .fble/.fble.@ combinations.
 - Add option for loading modules from .so files?

* Fbld Language Revision
 - modularity
 - native C implementation
   Including fble build time improvements.

* Add fble to rosettacode.org?
  Or at least implement all the tasks, perhaps in a separate RosettaCode
  package to start.
  Probably start with all the 'Simple' tasks.

* Design a standard library?
 - Separate modules as appropriate to reduce false dependencies.
 - Document all functions.
 - Add tests for full code coverage of all functions.

* New apps
 - IEEE floating point support.
 - More benchmark games.
 - Implement an image viewer.

* Fble Language Features
 - Add some way to catch or recover from errors at runtime?

* Fble Debugger
 - Add support for all backends.
