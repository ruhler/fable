Fble Profiler
=============
One of the main goals of the fble language is to support high performance, low
overhead computing. A profiler is an important tool to aid developers in
optimizing the performance of fble programs.

In practice a large amount of time is spent in a small amount of a program. A
key idea for optimizing a program is to identify where most of the time is
being spent and focus on optimizing that part of the program. There is little
value optimizing a part of the program if that part of the program takes
little time to run in the first place.

A profiler should provide programmers with actionable information. The actions
a programmer can take are to change the source code of a program. This means a
profiler should provide information in terms of source code that can be
changed.
