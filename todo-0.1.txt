Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

* BUILDSTAMP results in a -.gcno file for code coverage?
  Is that a problem? Do we need to handle it? How?

* Write release notes for release 0.1
* Add targets for clean, distclean, maintainer-clean.
* Add README.txt as a dist target?
* Add version numbers to README and generated docs?

* Reconsider use of BUILDSTAMP in fble-test, fble-app, fble-stdio.
 Because this requires users to define BUILDSTAMP when they do their own
 compiles.

* Double check why ninja www from dist doesn't think everything is up to date
  by default.

* Check if we are or should be installing libfble-<pkg>.a files.

* Document how to build with minimal dependencies?

* Describe how to build in place in README file?
  Because making a separate directory is just... more complicated?

* Double check we aren't using build_glob on source directories for dist_s
  that include non-source dist files.
  For example: parse.tab.c could get picked up incorrectly if src dir used for
  dist?

* Update documentation for how to enable/disable SDL/OpenGL dependencies.
 - Add nice error message if SDL not installed when fble-app is enabled saying
   how to disable fble-app.

* Update github workflow to test both with and without SDL.

* Define '::app' as a namespace instead?
 - Same with ::stdio, etc?

* Generate man pages for library functions via fbld.
* Make the official release.

* Clean up how we specify what gets built for which ninja targets?
 - For example, code coverage should be built by 'ninja check', but not be
   considered a test suite.

* Clean up specification of dependencies for fbld generated docs.
 - Fix missing dependency for .fbld processing on fbld.lang and fble.lang.
 - Maybe easiest to add a tcl proc for building fbld and encapsulate all the
   dependencies there.

* Improve exercises for Unions and Functions tutorials, and others.

* Fix dependencies in tutorials/build.tcl.
  In particular, they all depend on the core library implementation.

* Update usage help text with info about FBLE_PACKAGE_PATH, -p, and --package
  options.

* Set up default package path.
  Based on datadir configuration setting.

* Fix timeout with gdb-test
 - Just need to increase it a little in case of heavy CPU load?
 - Next time it happens, try to see where it got stuck?

* Figure out how to customize usage for compiled binaries
 - for example, fble-invaders should say fble-invaders in the usage, not
   fble-app.

* Generate fbld based man pages for binaries.
  fble-app
  fble-md5
  fble-sat
  fble-graphics
  fble-perf-profile
  fble-stdio
  fble-invaders
  fble-pinball
  fble-test

* How to check errors from stale files in build directory?
  For example, sat/Sat/sat-tests still existed, even though now were compiling
  to sat/sat-tests, but accidentally referencing the old sat/Sat/sat-tests
  path.

* Rename FbleVectorFree and FbleVectorInit to FbleInitVector and
  FbleFreeVector?
 - Or something that makes sense from a consistency point of view.

* Add tests that at least the compiled apps don't crash when you run them.

* [cleanup] Consistently document ownership of args to C functions?
 Borrowed: no transfer of ownership.
 Consumed: ownership transferred from caller to callee.
 Outlives: caller responsible for keeping alive as long as returned result is.
