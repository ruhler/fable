Sat Game
========
Making sure we have enough experience programming in fble this release, let's
implement a sat game.

First step: have a nicer Random@ interface. Because I'd like to reuse code for
things like random integers and shuffling lists.

The current interface for Random is LFSR@. You can shift out a Bit@. I'd like
something monadic. Like:

<<@>@>@ Random@ = <<@>@ M@> { *(
  M@<Bit@> bit
);

Something like that. Build on top of that:

<<@>@ M@> {
  (Random@<M@>) { M@<Bool@>; } Bool;
  (Random@<M@>) { M@<Int@>; } Int;
  (Random@<M@>)<@ A@>(List@<A@>) { M@<List@<A@>>; } Shuffle;
  ...
};

---

The key to start is I don't want to have to reference LFSR@ or Shifted@.

Maybe start by defining Random@ as part of SatGame package. We can move it to
core if it turns out to be useful.
