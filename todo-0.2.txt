Fble 0.2 TODO
=============
Things to do for the fble-0.2 release.

* tutorials/Introduction phonetic rendering of fble is turning into ?? in html
  output.
  Maybe due to use of unicode character not supported by fble Char@?
* Review all the generated documentation.
* Finalize release notes.

Usage docs
* Come up with a better story for building and integrating usage help text?
* Add usage generated help text to fble derived programs?
 graphics, md5, pinball, invaders, and sat?

Tutorial Improvements
* Improve exercises for Unions and Functions tutorials, and others.
  Because it looks a little funny in the tutorials for things to be
  highlighted in code blocks but not in inline text.
* Feedback from users:
 - Better explanation of "lack of primitives" and why that's a good thing.
 - Explain how features are related to procedural programming
   - Control Flow
   - Loops
   - Interfaces (?)
 - Better explanation of what it means to say a type is a value.
 - Better explanation of mapping from file name to module path early on.
 - Clarify that '%' is needed for module paths in early tutorials.
 - Better explanation of where to find existing and/or generated docs.
 - It's not obvious that 'xfail' means expected failure.
* Update App tutorial (if there is one?) for updated App@ interface.

Fbld Syntax Highlighting of html backend:
* Fbld
* Fble
* Consider syntax highlighting of the syntax specification in fble.fbld.
* Add way to do inline code syntax highlighting in fbld?
