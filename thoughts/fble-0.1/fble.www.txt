Fble WWW
========
Goal is to generate a website for fble from the source code. It should include
all the documentation about fble, including:
* Language spec
* tutorials
* doxygen for the public API (for users)
* doxygen for the internal API (for developers)
* doxygen(?) for the fble packages
* Generated man pages.
* home page.

Ideally we set up a 'www' ninja target that creates build/www/... with static
pages for the website that can be viewed locally. As extra bonus, once we have
something there to start, we could add a github action to uploaded it to a
github pages site.

I'm not sure where to start. So much information to include...

How about, start with:
* Summary and Overview from the README file.
* List of links to language spec, tutorials, doxygen, man pages, source code.

I think I want all the generated code to be html to start. Don't generate .md
or .adoc files, to ensure I have full control over how they are rendered, and
to let people view them all from a local browser. We'll have to figure out
style sheets I guess, to make it pretty. Oh well.

Let me make a www directory. It can have the home page and build rules for
generating the html content from other existing sources like doxygen, spec,
and tutorials.

---

For starters, I'm going to use asciidoc for the index page. We can change that
later. How do I link to the generated documentation from within a doc?

Let's organize www as:
www/
  index.html
  spec.html
  tutorials/
  doxygen/

Assume it's all going to be generated. Let's try some random things for the
links and see what happens.

Don't worry if not everything works. Don't worry about broken links. I'm
focusing on getting the infra to build and publish www to start.

Actually, let's use the README file for the main page to start. That ought to
have everything we want. I'm sure we can fix things up to work for it as a
direct README file and for generated www.

---

Next steps:
* How to turn this into a github pages www?
* How to make links to spec and tutorials work in generated www?
* How to turn directories into links, and where to link to?
* Move 'next' steps section much earlier to a documentation section in README.

Setting up github pages:
* I'll need to set up an action to build fble.
* I'll need a build target to the pages artifact.
  A single gzip archive containing a single tar file.

Actually, looks like there is an 'upload-pages-artifact' git hub action that
will take care of doing the tar gzip. We just need to give a path to the
generated static content. Perfect.

So, next step for gethub pages is to write a github action that can build
fble.

For the workflow:
* .github/workflows directory
* Call it a 'build' workflow in this case. It builds fble and can have a job
  to upload the pages site?
* Event: push
* Jobs: Env setup, build, upload pages
* Runner: Ubuntu Linux

Questions:
* What directory to use for build?

---

We now have github pages site setup. It takes from $::b/www directory anytime
we push to github.

Next step is to clean up the documentation however I like.

How to link to spec/fble.adoc from README.adoc, but spec/fble.html from
README.html?

Use an anchor and cross ref, and figure out how to run asciidoc on both docs
at once? Maybe need to use a 'chunked html' backend and treat them as two
separate sections of the same document? That seems silly to me.

---

The generated web pages from fbld look ugly. Can we add style sheets or
something to make them look a little nicer? Things to consider changing:
* Font family: Sans serif instead of serif.
* Font size: The text seems much too small compared to the titles.
* Maximum width: Set it at like 60 characters instead of window size?
* Colors: maybe there's less intense black/white colors we could use?
* Background color for code blocks maybe?

There are a couple parts here:
1. how to specify a different style.
2. what the style should be exactly.

The easiest way for (1) would be make it part of fbld html.tcl. Just emit it
as a stylesheet in the head. No need for a separate style sheet.

Let's play around a little.
