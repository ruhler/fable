Fble 0.5 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.5 release.

* Add spec test that would catch the bug if we failed to GcRealloc a value
  before ref assignment.
  - ref assign to a value which is stack alloc -> gc alloc -> ref.
  - The issue being, after substitution, we would end up with:
    stack -> gc -> stack, and when we return that, we would gc allocate it
    into: gc -> gc -> stack, and that stack value would then be dangling and
    likely to get overwritten.

Tutorials:
* C API, once it is stable enough.
* Add exercises to exercise each main point in every tutorial.
* /App/App%
* /Core/Test%

* Figure out why building with ninja from the source directory ends up
  building all the tests. And fix that somehow.

* fble-pprof doesn't work on windows because read isn't binary by default.
  Add an option to open? Coerce everything to binary, including stdio?

* Figure out how to add an fble-pprof benchmark to fble-benchmark?
  Either via support for pure embedded files, or IO in the benchmarks.

* Write release notes.
 - Add update to treatment of kinds.
