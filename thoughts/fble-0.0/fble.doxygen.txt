Fble Doxygen
============
So I've decided to try using doxygen for fable. See thoughts/fble.man.txt and
thoughts/fble.docs.txt for context.

This discussion is to track cleanup work on the use of doxygen.

Things that need to be done:
* Convert all doc comments over to doxygen.
* Enable warnings as errors once everything is converted.
* Fix dependency tracking.
* Add man pages to be installed.
* Figure out how to use relative include path instead of absolute in man page  
  name. DONE.
* Figure out how to add proper #include to SYNOPSIS of generated man pages.
* Come up with a doc comment style guide.
 - style for brief? DONE
 - style for @param description?
 - style for @returns description?

How do I change the file name used in the man page? FULL_PATH_NAMES = NO
maybe? Yeah. That does it.

Any way to avoid generating man pages for individual fields?

INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS  = YES?

No. Doesn't seem to do anything. I suppose I could always just avoid
installing those man pages?

Thoughts on style guide:

Brief. How is it used?

* brief for NAME of file in generated man page.
* Description under a function for SYNOPSIS section of man page.
* In table of contents listing in latex output.

Based on how it shows up, I'm initially leaning:
* Short description phrase. Capitalize first word.

For example:
* "Command line argument parsing."
* "Parse boolean flag."

Other inputs:
* man page brief is usually all lowercase:
  - "binary stream input/output"
  - "input of characters and strings"
  - "copy memory area"
* Sample brief descriptions from doxygen documentation:
  - "A brief history of JavaDoc-style (C-style) banner comments."
  - "Opens a file descriptor."
  - "A macro that returns the maximum of \a a and \a b."

I'm happy with my own leaning. I don't much care about traditional man page
styles. And probably best to be descriptive, as in, "Opens a file descriptor"
instead of "Open a file descriptor".

Same for @param and field briefs.

Okay! All public include files are converted over to doxygen now. I'm happy
with the change.

---

Note: I can remove the 'AUTHOR' section of a manpage by generating a layout
xml file with doxygen -l, then adding visible="no" to the authorsect of the
files page.

---

I'm going to remove doxygen. Why?
* It's a pretty big dependency.
* We have fbld we can use now to generate man pages, which we'll have more
  control over and can extend to support fble comments easily.
* I don't feel that strongly about having the compiler check the doc comments
  are present and match the signatures of the corresponding functions.

We can always revisit if we want this back again.
