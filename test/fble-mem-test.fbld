@usage[fble-mem-test] test memory behavior of an fble program
 @synopsis
 @ @l[fble-mem-test] \[@a[OPTION]...\] @l[-m] @a[MODULE_PATH]
 
 @description
  Tests for memory behavior of an fble function. The function should take a
  @l[/SpecTests/Nat%.Nat\@] as an argument. The function is evaluated with
  various values to see how memory use depends on the input value.
 
  By default, tests for O(1) memory use. If the @l[--growth] option is
  specified, tests for greater than O(1) memory use.
 
 @options
  @GenericProgramInfo
  @ModuleInput
 
  @subsection Test Options
   @opt[@l[--growth]]
    Expect the function to use greater than O(1) memory.
 
   @opt[@l[--debug]]
    Output graph of memory as a function of N, to help with debugging.
 
 @exitstatus
  @def[0] If memory growth is as expected.
  @def[1] If memory growth is not as expected.
  @def[2] Usage Error.
 
 @examples
  @ex[fble-mem-test -I foo -m /Foo%]
   Test that the function defined by @l[/Foo%] uses O(1) memory.
 
  @ex[fble-mem-test -I foo -m /Foo% --growth]
   Test that the function defined by @l[/Foo%] uses greater than O(1) memory.
