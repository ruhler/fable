Trading Simulation Game Idea
----------------------------
Think a mix between escape velocity, sim city, sim tower.

Fundamental concepts:
* Markets - places where you can buy and sell goods at different prices.
* Exploration - you explore to find new markets with new goods and new
  different prices.
* Trading - you carry goods from one market to another, making a profit on the
  difference in prices between the markets.
* Upgrades - you buy upgrades to your trading, such as:
  - expanding cargo space.
  - improving fuel economy, speed, security, etc.
  - technology to access new markets.
  - buying new trading ships.

The idea is you explore the world, find new markets, establish trade routes
for your ships by telling them where to go, buy new ships, upgrade your ships,
get access to new markets with new technologies and new upgrades. You build up
a trading empire. 

What's the goal / story line? How do you win the game? I'm not sure. Some
ideas: maybe you are on a quest to reach a specific market, that requires
unlocking expensive technologies. So the trick would be to make enough money
fast enough, and explore far enough, that you can find the fabled market you
want to get to. I like that. It doesn't add any new concepts to the game.

Another idea would be to have quests or a story line. Or have star ratings
like sim tower. Maybe you start in a small village and work your way up to
galactic trading. Or have various achievements to work through.

Random other thoughts:
* Maybe you can lay down roads on the terrain to build paths in a 2d space
  instead of jumping magically from market to market. Or maybe you can place
  walls / turrets along the road to make it more secure?
* Imagine upgrading from: walking, bicycling, car, going over water via a ship, 
  going over air with helicopter, etc.
* It would be awesome if you could see bustling trading routes somehow, to
  appreciate the complexity of the trading network built up.
* Perhaps you could have trading routes that meet up, like a warehouse at a
  market and you schedule different supplies to arrive at different places to
  be able to send them all over the world efficiently.
* Maybe some goods are perishable, so you need to be able to transport them
  fast to make money off them. Maybe some goods are valuable, so you need to
  be able to transport them securely.
* Maybe you can get a reliability rating or service record: x% delivery
  success.
