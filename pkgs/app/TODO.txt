* Add mouse button support.
* Clean up frame rate/event handling of /App/Demo%.
* Figure out how to support images in Apps.

* Change App% back to drawing over the previous screen?
 - It can figure out how to double buffer appropriately on the implementation
   side, for example by drawing the last two updates to the buffer.
 - Because presumably, if not much has changed, that can be much more
   efficient? And if a lot has changed, we can optimize 'Over' to throw away
   the previous frame entirely if you start with a blank screen?

   Maybe more accurate is, if your point of view isn't changing, delta is
   better. If your point of view is changing, you probably have to redraw
   everything regardless and it would be nice to avoid drawing a bunch of
   stuff and then covering it up right away.
