Fble 0.3 Release Burndown
=========================
I'm satisfied on performance work for this release. Let's start the release
burndown. What to focus on next?

Potential big things are:
* SatGame
* Rewrite fbld in C.
* Redesign debugger.
* Fbld modularity.
* Modular compilation.

How about we do some fble coding and work on SatGame next?
