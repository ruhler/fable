Native Value
============
The goal is to avoid having a destructor for Function Value. Instead use a
separate Native Value.

The trick is untangling FbleCode/FbleExecutableModule.

What should FbleCompiledModuleFunction be?

I think it should take a heap and a program. The program is a list of pairs of
(module_path, FbleValue). That is, the value of all the loaded modules so far.
A given module can look up and, if necessary, load any of its dependencies
into the program.

No need for FbleLink? The modules link themselves together?

And we have an option from the interpreter to load a module from code. It will
allocate a function with the code internally.

And we maybe can do something reasonable with profile blocks. As in, the
program also has profile blocks, and you add to the profile blocks when you
load the module.

I'll have to remember how I implement the generated code. Perhaps we could
avoid passing around a profile_block_offset everywhere? Not sure. One step at
a time.
