Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

* BUILDSTAMP results in a -.gcno file for code coverage?
  Is that a problem? Do we need to handle it? How?

* Write release notes for release 0.1
* Add targets for clean, distclean, maintainer-clean.
* Add README.txt as a dist target?
* Add version numbers to README and generated docs?

* Reconsider use of BUILDSTAMP in fble-test, fble-app, fble-stdio.
 Because this requires users to define BUILDSTAMP when they do their own
 compiles.

* Double check why ninja www from dist doesn't think everything is up to date
  by default.
  Looks like ninja has to build all targets before it will avoid building
  them. Just preserving timestamps is not enough.

* Check if we are or should be installing libfble-<pkg>.a files.

* Document how to build with minimal dependencies?

* Describe how to build in place in README file?
  Because making a separate directory is just... more complicated?

* Double check we aren't using build_glob on source directories for dist_s
  that include non-source dist files.
  For example: if you build in the source directory, and then build again,
  will that list some of the built files as sources incorrectly?

* Update documentation for how to enable/disable SDL/OpenGL dependencies.
 - Add nice error message if SDL not installed when fble-app is enabled saying
   how to disable fble-app.

* Update github workflow to test both with and without SDL.

* Generate man pages for library functions via fbld.
* Make the official release.

* Clean up specification of dependencies for fbld generated docs.
 - Fix missing dependency for .fbld processing on fbld.lang and fble.lang.
 - Maybe easiest to add a tcl proc for building fbld and encapsulate all the
   dependencies there.

* Improve exercises for Unions and Functions tutorials, and others.

* Fix dependencies in tutorials/build.tcl.
  In particular, they all depend on the core library implementation.
  Not sure how to do this easily. Something related to fble-deps?

* Update usage help text with info about FBLE_PACKAGE_PATH, -p, and --package
  options.

* Set up default package path.
  Based on datadir configuration setting.

* Figure out how to customize usage for compiled binaries
 - for example, fble-invaders should say fble-invaders in the usage, not
   fble-app.

* Generate fbld based man pages for binaries.
  fble-app
  fble-md5
  fble-sat
  fble-graphics
  fble-perf-profile
  fble-stdio
  fble-invaders
  fble-pinball
  fble-test

* Add tests that at least the compiled apps don't crash when you run them.

* [cleanup] Consistently document ownership of args to C functions?
 Borrowed: no transfer of ownership.
 Consumed: ownership transferred from caller to callee.
 Outlives: caller responsible for keeping alive as long as returned result is.
