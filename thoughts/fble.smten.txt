Fble Smten
==========
It occurs to me that it's probably pretty easy to add smten support to fble,
given all the value operations are encapsulated in value.c. That would be
cool.

What would it look like in practice?

For each kind of value, we need a way to represent it symbolically, and
support for a p ? x : y operation, where p is a boolean formula.

Wow. There are only a handful of different kinds of values. That's nice.

DATA_TYPE_VALUE: 
  No need to support symbolic representation, because we know from the type
  what the concrete value is.

STRUCT_VALUE:
  No change.
  p ? x : y  ==> @(p ? x.0 : y.0, p ? x.1 : y.1, ...) for fields 0, 1, etc.

UNION_VALUE:
  Add an extra tag value that says symbolic. Represent it as a vector of pairs
  of (formula, arg) for each possible tag.
  p ? x : y ==> 
    if x and y have the same tag, push it in.
    if x and y have different tags, turn into symbolic.
    if x or y are symbolic, turn into symbolic
       @(0: (p ? x.0.p : y.0.p, p ? x.0.v : y.0.v), 1: ...)

  Case for symbolic returns x.0.p ? 0 : (x.1.p ? 1 : ...)
  Field access for symbolic returns the value directly? It's just silently
  undefined behavior if you access the wrong tag?

FUNC_VALUE:
  Add a symbolic option to store a function as
  p ? x : y
  Then p ? x : y becomes primitive constructor.

  Application on symbolic is implemented as
    p ? (x a) : (y a)

  This is where things get tricky complexity wise, and users have to be aware.

REF_VALUE
  No change.
  p ? x : y ==> @(p ? x.v : y.v)

  Except maybe we say if either x or y is NULL, the result is NULL.
  Or whichever is non-NULL, because it's like undefined behavior if you try to
  access NULL?
  Or maybe we don't have to worry about this case because you can't run a
  query inside of a let definition, only at the top level.

Then we add a top level interface:

<<@>@>@ Smten@ = <<@>@ M@, <@>@ S@> { *(
  Monad@<M@> m,
  Monad@<S@> s,
  <@ A@> { S@<A@>; } zero,
  <@ A@>(S@<A@>, S@<A@>) { S@<A@>; } plus,
  <@ A@>(S@<A@>) { M@<Maybe@<A@>>; } query
); };

Where s.return is like a singleton, and s.do gives you ability to do join.

In terms of implementation, we need:
* Use minisat I think.
* FbleFormula* type, which is wrapper around minisat.
* FbleS*, which is (FbleFormula*, FbleValue*).
* zero is implemented as (False, NULL).
* plus is implemented as p ? x : y, for a new free variable p.
* s.return is implemented as (True, x).
* s.do is implemented as: do (p, x) f
   let (q, y) = f x
   (p & q, y)
* m is the same IO monad we already have.
* query is implemented as using minisat to solve the formula, and then perform
  substitution. So we'll also want to implement a 'subst' for values that
  takes a value and assignment and removes any variables left.

In other words, this is totally doable. Changes are limited to:
* Updates to value.c, and some new functions in value.h related to symbolic
  values (subst, conditional).
* A new class for smten.c for smten specific logic.
* A new top level fble-stmen program.

There's a question about how to deliver this. Do I want to have fble support
smten by default, or somehow make it separate?

Downsides of always smten:
* Added dependency on minisat.
* Potential overheads of value operations given extra constructors for
  symbolic execution. Though honestly, I think this would be pretty small. We
  could even have separate SYMBOLIC_UNION and SYMBOLIC_FUNC values to avoid
  memory overheads.
* Doesn't scale well to other special execution smten-like things we might
  want to add to fble (not that I can think of any more off the top of my
  head.) Maybe profiling falls into this category?

Upsides of always smten:
* Much easier to maintain, and easier for people to use. Nothing special
  needed.

If we wanted to split, a couple ways we could do it:
* Using #ifdef in the code. So, compile time option.
* Using a separate branch of the git repo.

minisat is a pretty small dependency. I'm not worried about that, as long as
it is easy to install. Maybe we can even include it in the repo, depending on
licensing. My vote is to add smten directly to the main branch. Don't separate
it.

You know, if we add smten to fble, this could be a big differentiator. Big
enough, perhaps, to suggest renaming fble as a smten 2.0 kind of thing.

Another question is whether we want symbolic support for recursive functions,
where you unroll it partially. How would that look? Sounds harder. Maybe let's
not worry about that to start.

I think we want access to the S@ to have the formula. Then we could represent
S@ as a ... not sure. Yeah, let's worry about that later.

---

What's my first test case for this? Sudoku? That's probably a good one. Add a
pkg/smten for smten-based stuff. smten/Sudoku is a Sudoku implementation that
defines a free board, asserts all the constraints are met.
