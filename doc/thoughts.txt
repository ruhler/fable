* It would be nice to have an infrastructure for checking and defining errors.
This could be used for static assertions, dynamic checks, and test cases.
The idea is: we have a way to report an error, including file and line number,
the type of error, and additional dynamic information. Somehow that can be
appropriately interpreted and reported.

Use C++ exceptions? Should it be part of the interface to a function what
errors it can encounter? Is there a difference between: Something unexpected
happened and you used this function wrong?

Solution: see error.h for my interface.

* Maybe it would be nice to have an infrastructure for adding debug printf
  statements?

* It would be nice if the make file could make itself right.
As in, make it easy to automatically compute dependencies if possible.

Solution: Use ninja instead of make. Hurray!

* There are two different consumers of a description: Humans and computers.
Computers read the description and do something based on it.
Humans read the description to understand it.

Humans are (much) better at understanding natural language than structured
code. So, even if the structured code has all the information, it's much
easier to understand if it is accompanied with a natural language description.

It is vital that a natural language description can be associated with parts
of structured code. Can you imagine how awful a programming language would be
that didn't have a way to include comments?

The question is, is there a nice, uniform, way to support comments in
structured descriptions of code? Usually I want the comment associated with
some specific part of the structured description.

I almost want something like gerrit code review: you can select a component
and add a comment to it which shows up orthogonal to the structured code. That
is, you have a way to add comments outside of the sequence of characters used
to describe the code.

If we had an editor and viewer to support this, that would be awesome. That
suggests I really want a richer interface to humans than just a static
sequence of characters. I want something where the human can point to
something, and see additional info. Then they can point somewhere else, and
get other info somewhere else.

* Copy versus share...
I'm running into this question. When should I share code, and when should I
copy it? I can't bear to copy code, just because I know things will get out of
sync. But there is a real cost to sharing code. You introduce dependencies you
wouldn't otherwise have. You introduce indirection you wouldn't otherwise
have. It's much harder to change code, because you have to know all of the
users of the code.
