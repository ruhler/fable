Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

* Convert doc comments and generate man pages for all C api functions.
  fble-load.h
  fble-loc.h
  fble-module-path.h
  fble-name.h
  fble-profile.h
  fble-string.h
  fble-vector.h
  fble-version.h

* Code for man pages looks like something is messed up.
  See FbleGenerateAArch64Main.3 for example. Looks like a newline got lost.
* Any way to have SYNOPSYS for dc man pages wrap arguments more nicely?

* Document default fble package path in man pages?
  We can get it from $::config::datadir/fble
  How best to pass that into the docs?
  Auto-generate a .tcl file that defines a config tag? Like: @config[datadir]?
  
* Add version numbers to generated docs?
  - Add another argument to @man tag to pass the 'source' and read from
    @config[version].

Release Related:
* Verify the release candidate every way I can.
  Automating as much as that verification as possible. Including:
  - Make sure we can build, check, and install from release distribution.
  - Walk through tutorials and make sure those work.
  - Check if we can disable SDL properly?
  - Proofread all tutorials?
  - Review all the man pages and usage help text?
  - Double check all links in the generated web page? And proofread?
* Write release notes for release 0.1
* Make the official release.
