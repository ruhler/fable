Fble Compile Performance
=======================

Compiling /Fbld/Main% takes almost a minute, which is very painful. Figure out
why it's so slow and make it not be so slow.

There are two approaches, both of which we should take.

1. Profile and optimize.

2. Add proper support for modular compilation, so we only have to read the
types of included modules, not typecheck them too.

Starting with (1).
