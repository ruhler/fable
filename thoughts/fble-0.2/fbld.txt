Fbld Improvements
=================

I'm happy with the syntax for fbld. The implementation needs work.

One idea is to try implementing fbld in fble. Partly as an excuse to write
more real world fble programs, partly because it almost feels nicer to use
fble than tcl given things like tracking error locations.

I see two big challenges with using fble for fbld:
1. How to make it easily extensible. Can users write their own front ends and
back ends? Would they have to write fble? Is that too much to ask? How can we
compose with other existing programs like groff?

2. How to deal with bootstrapping dependency of fble on fbld and fbld on fble?
It's a bit annoying, because it's just the help text for fble-stdio. Maybe
have an option to compile fble with and without that usage text and do a mini
bootstrap that way in the build system.

Big things I want to improve for fbld (regardless of what language we use to
implement it):
* Location tracking, so we can point to the exact place in a file where an
  error occurs.

* Composition: so we can easily implement commands directly in terms of other
  commands if we want to, instead of having to convert back into strings and
  re-parsing.

Both those things come down to this challenging aspect of fbld:

The commands have to parse args using fbld, the fbld parser has to execute
commands using the commands. That creates this cycle going back and forth
between the parser and commands where we have to keep track of and pass
location information back and forth. We can't just parse the whole thing all
at once and then execute commands all at once.
