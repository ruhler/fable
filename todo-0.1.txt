Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

* Do we install header files needed by users of the library packages?
  Should we? For example pkgs/core/int.fble.h.
* Update examples in man pages to use -p options appropriate for the package?
* Usage output does not work well when piping to less
  It shows a bunch of [ESC like stuff in the output text.
* Document default fble package path in man pages?
  Meaning, the exact value we end up installing.
* Generate man pages for library functions via fbld.
* Add version numbers to generated docs?

Release Related:
* Verify the release candidate every way I can.
  Automating as much as that verification as possible. Including:
  - Make sure we can build, check, and install from release distribution.
  - Walk through tutorials and make sure those work.
  - Check if we can disable SDL properly?
  - Proofread all tutorials?
  - Review all the man pages and usage help text?
  - Double check all links in the generated web page? And proofread?
* Write release notes for release 0.1
* Make the official release.
