Tutorial
========
Goal: write an fble tutorial to help people with getting started.

I'm thinking we could start with a program that does 4 bit bitwise arithmetic
operations, without any use of the core packages or other libraries.

Brainstorm of chapters:
* introduction, goals, scope of tutorial.
* first fble program
  - 4 bit AND operation, including types, variables, functions.
  - use fble-test program to assert you get the right result.
* first fble program in detail
  - Add lots of extra details about all the bits of the program in the
    previous section. Things like kinds versus types, types as values, etc.
    Assuming there is enough of interest there.
* Writing your own main function.
  - Write a main function to print out the result of a computation instead of
    using asserts.
  - Write a main function that takes inputs on the command line, calls a
    function, and then outputs the result.
  - Run both of these with the interpreter.
* Compiling code.
  - Using the main function from before, invoke the compiler to compile the
    code. Either via C or via aarch64.
* Profiling code.
  - with --profile
  - with linux perf
* Debugging code.
* Working with modules.
  - How to run interpreted.
  - How to compile with all the right dependencies.
* Core library: Stdio program
  - intro to core package and common modules in there.
  - discussion of monads and what all that involves.
  - stdio@ interface.
