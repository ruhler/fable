HTTP Profile Viewer
===================
Goal is to write an http based profile viewer.

Here I'm specifically interested in the http server aspects of writing it.
What minimal http support can I provide myself? What library dependencies must
we have?

Here's an example HTTP request:

  GET /hello.html?foo=bar HTTP/1.1
  Host: localhost:8000
  User-Agent: Elinks
  Accept: */*
  Accept-Language: en
  Connection: Keep-Alive

Here's an example HTTP response (from wget -S ...).

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html
  Accept-Ranges: bytes
  ETag: "1512195059"
  Last-Modified: Sat, 08 Jan 2022 20:18:45 GMT
  Content-Length: 1062
  Date: Tue, 22 Oct 2024 14:11:07 GMT
  Server: lighttpd/1.4.53

Steps to make this work:

1. Write code for main loop to start a server and accept a connection.
For this part, just print the request.

2. Parse the GET request and headers.

3. Generate some sample responses that I can try with elinks.

The most annoying part, I think, is having to output content length. It means
I can't stream the output? I need two passes?
