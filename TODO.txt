* Switch to library-based sharing rather than file based sharing.
 - morph fblct.h to match fblc.h expr and actn definitions.
  -- Remove Strip.c. A type cast should be sufficient.
 - Remove expect_result_b tests.
 - Implement fblc-test
  -- continue to test writing and reading fblc programs?
 - Replace expect_result and expect_proc_result with fblc-test

* Use consistent naming in spec tests to distinguish between:
  - Something with the wrong syntax, such as ???. "malformed"
  - Something that cannot be typed, such as x, when x is not defined.  "maltyped"
  - Something with the wrong type, such as Donut(), when Unit() is expected. "mistyped"

* Test that tail recursive functions and procedures don't smash the stack.
* Test that a link's type is valid.
* Test that a link action's ports can't shadow ports already in scope.
* Test that a link can't use the same name for the get and put ports.
* Test that a proc can't have multiple ports of the same name, with or without
  the same polarity.
* Test what happens when we try to access the wrong field of a union.

* Better document that for binary encodings of values, the top level value is
  guarenteed to take at least one bytes, regardless of whether or not it is
  part of a stream.

* Test writing a stream of Units
 - which requires some alignment be done.

* Implement fbld front end to fblcbi.
* Port calc Integer to an fbld module.
* Implement space invaders game in fbld.
* Write man pages for fblc and friends?
