Trying to fix performance issues with Invaders game, here's what I see:

* Fullscreen versus 640x480 makes a huge difference, because the draw screen
  is proportional to the size of the screen.
* At 60FPS, shift velocity of 3 pixels per tick looks like about the right
  speed and looks pretty smooth. I think this is a good target.

Is there anything I can do to make the Draw function take time proportional to
the shape of what's being drawn instead of the resolution of the window?

Proposal: Add Transform as part of the NativeApp interface.

Benefits:
* We don't have to reallocate a bunch of paths every time on fble side.
* We do most of the transformation math on the C side where it is fast.
* The draw function can take advantage of the transformation to spend time
  proportional to the pre-transformed path size instead of the
  post-transformed path size.
