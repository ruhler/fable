Library Organization
====================
The prgms directory is getting big enough now that it wants organizing. But
how should the fble library and programs be organized? Ideally there is some
notion of layering of which parts of the library can depend on which other
parts of the library. Ideally there is some way to separate things like hwdg
from the core library.

What exists today, and how I might organize it:

  Core: Bool, Char, Eq, Int, Literal, List, Loop, Maybe, Process, Show,
        String, Test, Unit

  I/O: Stdio, {App, Drawing}

  Utilities: Hex, Bits, {Map, Structured}

  Apps: DataFlow, GameOfLife, Hwdg, Invaders, Md5, Primes, Sat, Snake,
        Sudoku, TicTacToe

  Fble

I kind of wish Int didn't have to be part of Core, but it's used in Test,
which I think should be part of core? Maybe not?

Ideally each module only has visibility of those other modules that it is
allowed to. For example, GameOfLife shouldn't have any visibility of Invaders
and vice versa. Char shouldn't have any visibility of Stdio. It's like there's
a notion of visibility separate from dependence. Is there any way I can work
that into the build system? Or the search path?
