Mutation
========

Scenario: I want to implement an fble program that counts the number of
occurrences of each character in a file. I use a map from character to Int@
value. I read character by character, incrementing the corresponding map entry
as we go.

I could implement this in C allocating O(1) memory, because we update integer
values in place.

I can't implement this in fble without allocating O(N) memory, where N is
proportional to the number of characters in the input file.

That's really bad from a performance point of view, wouldn't you say? Unless
you think allocation cost basically nothing and that what we really care about
is how much we are using at any one time. But you don't believe that, right? I
don't believe that, right?

So, idea is: add support for in-place mutation of data structures to the fble
language. Do it this way:
* Allow the user to express that they require in-place mutation to happen.
* The compiler reports an error if your in-place mutation is unsafe.
  That is, you aren't the sole owner of whatever you are requiring to be
  mutated.
* It composes well with everything else in fble.

That last requirement gives us a good starting point. You should be able to
write a function, such as a list map, that can be used both for in-place
mutation and copy-on-write mutation without change.

I claim we can express 'mutation' in the language and interpret it as
copy-on-write. So we could get the syntax in place, and it's probably nice and
useful syntax to have for fble, even if we never really do things in place.

Real quickly:

A mutator is:
* An arbitrary function of type T -> T
* A struct field mutation: struct type + field name + mutator
  That turns a mutator on a field into a mutator on the struct value.
* A union field mutation: union type + field name + mutator
  That turns a mutator on an arg into a mutator on the union value.

A mutation expression is:
* An object + a mutator. It applies the mutation function to the object to get
  a new object and returns the result. Initially a copy, but eventually,
  hopefully, with some way to reuse memory in place.

A variable mutation statement is:
* A variable name in scope + a mutator. It applies the mutation function to
  the variable value, then resets the variable to refer to the new value.

And some mechanism for enforcement:
* The requirement is you are applying mutation to the last use of an
  expression. Sounds tricky. But that's the idea.

Proposed syntax for mutation:

Assignment:
 <expr> ~(<path>: <expr>)

Transformation:
 <expr> ~(<path>:= <expr>)

This replaces the existing struct copy syntax. Instead of '.@', use '~'. And
let's say you can add a list of assignments. So, generalization is instead of
a name, you pass a field path of 1 or more fields.

We don't have direct in place mutation. Just use normal function application?
f(x), or, if you really want: f~(x)?

Map = (List@<T@> xs) {
  xs.?(nil: xs);
  xs~(cons.head := F, cons.tail := Map);
};

Um. xs~(cons.head: F(xs.cons.head))
 ==> xs~(cons.head := F). Sounds reasonable enough to me.

It doesn't feel intuitive to me though. What would be intuitive?

  xs.cons.head = F(xs.cons.head);
  xs.cons.tail = Map(xs.cons.tail);

Maybe you get used to the shorter version?

  xs~(cons.head.= F, cons.tail.= Map);
  xs~(cons.head := F, cons.tail := Map);
  xs~(cons.head: Foo);
  xs~(cons.head : Foo);
  xs~(cons.head:= F, cons.tail:= Map);

I think I like .= more than :=? Either way I suppose.
