* Implement Expr operator<< for test purposes.
* Implement and test Expr equality operators.
* Uncomment that CHECK that's commented out in function.cc
* Implement parser (steal from what I have and nuke circuit, truth_table)
* Write main interpreter executable


Future Ideas:
* It would be nice to have a source-level androcles debugger.
* Think harder about how libraries should work, and how to access components
  in libraries. As opposed to having a single file listing all the types and
  functions in order.
