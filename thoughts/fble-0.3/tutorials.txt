Tutorial Review
===============

For fble 0.3, we need to revise the tutorials now that we removed
multi-argument functions, and the implications that has for type inference.

Should we do more while we are at it? Possible ideas:

* Remove scary language from the tutorials.
* Create special Stdio App run functions to greatly simplify the main function
  needed for the tutorials?
* Consider adding a separate line of tutorials that are application based
  instead of language feature based?

If we did application based tutorials, what would be some fun applications to
start with?
* tic tac toe?
* sudoku solver?
* card games?
* prime numbers?
* benchmark games?
* rosetta code tasks?
