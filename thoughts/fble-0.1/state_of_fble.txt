The State of Fble
=================
Here we take a step back and look at the overall state of the fble project.

Language
--------
The language has mostly stabilized. It's not changing much. It's starting to
be my preferred language to write programs in. It's actually pretty nice to
use.

The biggest issues with the language at this point are:
* It's too slow to run programs. This is a pretty hard blocker for things like
  the space invaders game.

* Poor modularity support. Most notably no support for abstract data types.
  That may be the reason I haven't made use of the module access controls at
  all. Who knows what the story will be for modular compilation or package
  version control.

* It feels like more cognitive overhead to program in than it ought to. I
  think this could be related to how, with nested conditions, the flow of code
  jumps all over the source file. Compare to C programs, where you can write
  programs in a much more linear fashion by returning early in if statements.

If we can focus on addressing these three things next, that would be great.

For the performance issue we have under way the experimental elaborate feature
of the language. It's is not fully flushed out how that feature will work for
things like loops and processes. It's really in an exploratory phase. I should
push forward with the exploration to see what we learn.

Honestly, even under my most optimistic interpretation, I don't expect the
elaborate feature to address the performance issue. There's something
fundamental about a 64 bit add taking on the order of 64 operations instead of
a single native machine instruction. Performance is the biggest risk for fble.

For modularity, I have a proposal in the works for abstract data types. It
would be good to get an initial version of the proposal implemented and play
around with it.

For cognitive overhead, I haven't thought about how we could improve things
yet. It's worth spending some thought on it. I think this is a relatively
minor issue at this point compared to performance.

Library
-------
The library has intentionally been left to grow organically as needed by the
fble programs I write. It's got some nice stuff, but deserves a well thought
reworking of all the APIs when the time comes. Mostly I want to wait on
language support for abstract data types before even thinking about how to
clean up the library.

Tools
-----
Running, profiling and code coverage feel good to me. The biggest thing
missing is a debugger, which I've wanted many times. But every time I've
figured out the issue with much less effort than developing a debug entails.

I don't think I'm ready to take on the project of a debugger yet. It might be
good to wait until we've made more progress on language performance, in case
that means using compiled code in such a way that we can reuse a standard
debugger.

Apps
----
The only app that really matters at this point is the invaders game. We should
finish the app so we can use it to understand how far we have to go
performance wise to make fble useful.

Summary
-------
I suggest the following areas of focus for fble next, in no particular order:

* Finish invaders game functionally.
* Implement proposal for abstract data types.
* Continue exploration of elaborate feature to improve performance.
* Burn down easy to fix TODOs.
* Spend some time thinking about cognitive overheads and what, if anything, we
  can do to address them.

That's plenty of different stuff to work on. I wouldn't take on any more
before these things are closed out.

The State of Fble Update
========================
I've made enough progress on the invaders game to see that addressing
the performance issue is critical for fble to be viable. It is the top
priority.

Current status on performance:
* I've proposed an fblf language to embed in fble that, hopefully, address all
  the performance concerns of fble. I've implemented md5 in fblf, but run into
  memory issues with the fblf compiler that need some modifications to the
  fblf language to properly resolve, namely: don't inline everything in fblf.

* I've proposed an fble elaborate expression and started adding support to it
  in fble. It's blocked on updates to the interpreter to make it easier to
  compile a symbolic case expression. But I worry this approach won't address
  a number of important concerns that fblf does (which was the motivation for
  fblf), and I'm realizing from the work on fblf that this approach is going
  to run into the same problem that we can't just inline everything
  completely.

I will continue to focus on fblf, revising the language to address the
inlining problem, and go from there. Everything we learn from fblf can
hopefully be transferred to improve fble performance (possibly via elaborate
expression) eventually.

The State of Fble Update
========================
Performance for invaders game is now solved. Though there will always be a
desire for improved performance.

I've revised abstract data type support to something that seems reasonable to
me. Though I haven't tried it out too extensively. I've reorganized the fble
library code into packages that could make use of the abstract data type
support.

I've added conditional statements and some preliminary type inference, which
helps a lot with cognitive overheads of programming fble, I hope.

I haven't spent time to seriously clean up the library yet. I still don't
think we are ready for that.

We have some initial debugger support via dwarf and gdb that's useful enough
to start.

Top of mind things now are:
* Clean up the language spec support for type inference, because it would be
  nice for it to work for struct and union values as well as functions.
* Burn down TODOs that are easy enough to do, because they always continue to
  grow.
* Spend more time programming in fble, for things like sat, etc. To test out
  the type inference and see if we really have overcome cognitive overheads,
  or if there are still some fundamental issues (like immutable values and
  performance still).
* Start thinking more about cross platform support.
  I'm working on a game in a different framework because that framework has
  cross platform support. That means it's important.

The State of Fble Update
========================
* The language spec for type inference has been cleaned up.
* I added support for compilation via C, so it can run compiled no different
  platforms.
* The interface for implementing Fble functions from C code is now much
  cleaner, and we've simplified the internal implementation by using the
  native stack for everything except tail calls.

The language feels like it's in a solid state now. The next big thing for fble
is to make an initial release and get it to be practically useable.

This means updating documentation in code, cleaning up usage help text, adding
man pages, and writing tutorials. Work on cleaning up API and general usage
while I'm at it. Burn down TODOs as well.

Some top of mind items:
* All around documentation updates, including doxygen, man pages, tutorials,
  auto-generated website.
* Hardening the configure and build scripts.
* Burning down TODOs.
* Whatever else I need to feel comfortable with making a release version 0.1.

In my mind, we are feature complete enough for a release. Don't worry about
the fact that the library packages aren't well thought out. The important
thing is that the core language spec is in great shape and we have a solid
reference implementation of it. That's enough for release 0.1, as long as
there is sufficient documentation and robustness for others to be able to use
it.

The State of Fble Update
========================
fble-0.1 has been released.

The biggest thing next in my mind is:
* Write lots and lots of programs in fble.
* Figure out a better story for persistent storage, e.g. invaders high score
  tracking.

Writing lots more programs should help flush out the most important issues to
resolve with fble.
