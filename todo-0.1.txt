Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

* @code for man pages looks like something is messed up.
  See FbleGenerateAArch64Main.3 for example. Looks like a newline got lost.

* Any way to have SYNOPSIS for dc man pages wrap arguments more nicely?
  
* Add version numbers to other generated docs?
 - www? readme? tutorials? language specs?

Release Related:
* Verify the release candidate every way I can.
  Automating as much as that verification as possible. Including:
  - Make sure we can build, check, and install from release distribution.
  - Walk through tutorials and make sure those work.
  - Check if we can disable SDL properly?
  - Proofread all tutorials?
  - Review all the man pages and usage help text?
  - Double check all links in the generated web page? And proofread?
* Write release notes for release 0.1
* Make the official release.
