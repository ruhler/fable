* It would be nice if 'Wrong number of arguments to ...' reported the opening
  '(' as the location of the error.
* Test what happens when we try to access the wrong field of a union.
  And check if we can easily show the location in the runtime error message.
* Clean up the error messages.
   - Put names in single quotes always.
   - Say 'expecting expression of type X' instead of 'expecting type X' when
     we are expecting an expression.
* Be able to parse from a string as well as a file.
  - Then add a '-e' option to fblc to specify an arbitrary expression to
    evaluate in the context of the given program.
* Be able to parse from a list of files instead of just one?
  This will help for tests or other programs that share some common functions.
* Implement support for processes.
* Write a man page for fblc?
* Write a vim syntax for fblc?
* Add code coverage to the build?
* Write tests to get 100% code coverage, or reasonably close.
  - Manually review reported errors for 'e' test cases to make sure the test
    case works and the error reported is correct.
    (any better way to automate this kind of testing?)
* Organize and rename malformed tests based on the specification?
* Start work on a calculator program as a basic test for processes.
