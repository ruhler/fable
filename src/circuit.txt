Type: 
  Opaque, globally named primitive type.

Port:
  Identifier and type

Module:
  Zero or more input ports
  Zero or more output ports

Primitive Modules:
  ZERO
  ONE
  NAND

Composing Modules:
  Directed acyclic graph of submodules where each edge goes from an output
  port to an input port, both of which have the same types.

Bit Modules:
  Modules whose inputs and outputs all have type BIT.
  These can be defined by truth table.
