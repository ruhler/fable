Fble 0.1 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.1 release.

Release Related:
* Write release notes for release 0.1
* Make the official release.

Build Related:
* Set up default package path.
  Based on datadir configuration setting.
* Update github workflow to test both with and without SDL?
* Double check we aren't using build_glob on source directories for dist_s
  that include built files.
  For example: if you build in the source directory, and then build again,
  will that list some of the built files as sources incorrectly?
* BUILDSTAMP results in a -.gcno file for code coverage?
  Is that a problem? Do we need to handle it? How?
* Reconsider use of BUILDSTAMP in fble-test, fble-app, fble-stdio.
 Because this requires users to define BUILDSTAMP when they do their own
 compiles.

Documentation Related:
* Document how to build with minimal dependencies?
* Update usage help text with info about FBLE_PACKAGE_PATH, -p, and --package
  options.
* Figure out how to customize usage for compiled binaries
 - for example, fble-invaders should say fble-invaders in the usage, not
   fble-app.
* Generate fbld based man pages for binaries.
  fble-app
  fble-md5
  fble-sat
  fble-graphics
  fble-perf-profile
  fble-stdio
  fble-invaders
  fble-pinball
  fble-test
* Generate man pages for library functions via fbld.
* Update documentation for how to enable/disable SDL/OpenGL dependencies.
 - Add nice error message if SDL not installed when fble-app is enabled saying
   how to disable fble-app.
* Add version numbers to generated docs?
