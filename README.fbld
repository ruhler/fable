@doc Fable README
  @FbleVersion (@BuildStamp)

 Fable is a programming language project. It includes a specification,
 reference implementation, library, and sample applications for the fble
 programming language.

 @section Overview
  Fable is a hobby project to design my own programming language. My goal is to
  design a general purpose programming language good enough to be my preferred
  programming language.

 @section Source
  The source code for fble is available from github at
  @url[https://github.com/ruhler/fable].

 @section Documentation
  @def[Fble Language Specification] @fbld[spec/fble.fbld]
  @def[Fbld Document Markup Specification] @fbld[fbld/fbld.fbld]
  @def[Tutorials] @fbld[tutorials/Tutorials.fbld]
  @def[Release Notes] @fbld[Release.fbld]

  The latest generated documentation is also available online at
  @url[https://ruhler.github.io/fable].

 @section Build Requirements
  To build and run the tests for all of fble, the following software is
  required. The version numbers provided are versions that are known to work:

  @def[Expect 5.45.4] To test fble debugging.
  @def[GNU Binutils for Debian 2.31.1] For assembling compiled fble programs.
  @def[GNU Bison 3.3.2] For generating the fble parser.
  @def[GNU Compiler Collection (Debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0] For compiling fble.
  @def[GNU Debugger (Debian 8.2.1-2+b3) 8.2.1] Used to test fble debugging.
  @def[GNU diffutils 3.7] For some test cases.
  @def[GNU grep 3.3] For some test cases.
  @def[GNU groff version 1.22.4] For formatting help usage text.
  @def[GNU Source-highlight 3.1.8 (library: 4:1:0)] For doc syntax highlighting.
  @def[Ninja 1.10.1] For the build system.
  @def[Open GL 1.2] For graphical fble apps.
  @def[Simple DirectMedia Layer 2.0.9] For graphical fble apps.
  @def[Tcl 8.6] For generating build ninja files.

  To install required dependencies on a debian based system:

  @code[sh]
   apt install \
     expect binutils bison \
     gcc gdb diffutils grep groff-base source-highlight \
     ninja-build libgl-dev libsdl2-dev tcl8.6

 @section Build
  To build and install:

  @code[sh]
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && ninja && ninja install

  Additional ninja targets:

  @def[test] Runs tests on uninstalled binaries.
  @def[www] Builds html documentation.
  @def[dist] Builds a release tarball.
  @def[check] Builds and tests everything without installing anything.

 @section Vim Files
  Vim ftplugin, syntax, and indent files for the fble language are available
  in the `vim/` directory. You can run the following commands to install these
  files:

  @code[sh]
   mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftdetect ~/.vim/ftplugin ~/.vim/indent ~/.vim/syntax
   cp vim/ftdetect/* ~/.vim/ftdetect
   cp vim/ftplugin/* ~/.vim/ftplugin
   cp vim/indent/* ~/.vim/indent
   cp vim/syntax/* ~/.vim/syntax
