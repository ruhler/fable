HTTP Profile Viewer
===================
Goal is to write an http based profile viewer.

Here I'm specifically interested in the http server aspects of writing it.
What minimal http support can I provide myself? What library dependencies must
we have?

Here's an example HTTP request:

GET /hello.html?foo=bar HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
User-Agent: Elinks
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
Connection: Keep-Alive

Here's an example HTTP response (from wget -S ...).

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html
  Accept-Ranges: bytes
  ETag: "1512195059"
  Last-Modified: Sat, 08 Jan 2022 20:18:45 GMT
  Content-Length: 1062
  Date: Tue, 22 Oct 2024 14:11:07 GMT
  Server: lighttpd/1.4.53

Steps to make this work:

1. Write code for main loop to start a server and accept a connection.
For this part, just print the request.

2. Parse the GET request and headers.

3. Generate some sample responses that I can try with elinks.

The most annoying part, I think, is having to output content length. It means
I can't stream the output? I need two passes?

Done with step (1). Next is step (2).

Some challenges we are going to have with this server:
* It's not C99. It requires posix.

Interpretation of the sample headers:

Accept: */*
  Says what kind of responses to accept. If our response is not in the list,
  we should return 406 error code. Probably safe to ignore to begin.
  
Accept-Language: en
  Preferred language to return. Probably safe to ignore to begin.

Connection: Keep-Alive
  Seems to suggest the user agent supports keeping the connection alive, but I
  don't think requires it. Probably safe to ignore to begin.

Host: localhost:8000
  Host and optional port of origin. Probably safe to ignore, but in theory we
  should return 400 (bad request) if it is missing.

User-Agent: Elinks
  The user agent. Safe to ignore.

In other words, to start, I can ignore all of these fields. Just skip past
them, and I'm done and ready to respond.

What response headers do I want to provide?

general-header = Cache-Control            ; Section 14.9
               | Connection               ; Section 14.10
               | Date                     ; Section 14.18
               | Pragma                   ; Section 14.32
               | Trailer                  ; Section 14.40
               | Transfer-Encoding        ; Section 14.41
               | Upgrade                  ; Section 14.42
               | Via                      ; Section 14.45
               | Warning                  ; Section 14.46

response-header = Accept-Ranges           ; Section 14.5
                | Age                     ; Section 14.6
                | ETag                    ; Section 14.19
                | Location                ; Section 14.30
                | Proxy-Authenticate      ; Section 14.33
                | Retry-After             ; Section 14.37
                | Server                  ; Section 14.38
                | Vary                    ; Section 14.44
                | WWW-Authenticate        ; Section 14.47

entity-header  = Allow                    ; Section 14.7
               | Content-Encoding         ; Section 14.11
               | Content-Language         ; Section 14.12
               | Content-Length           ; Section 14.13
               | Content-Location         ; Section 14.14
               | Content-MD5              ; Section 14.15
               | Content-Range            ; Section 14.16
               | Content-Type             ; Section 14.17
               | Expires                  ; Section 14.21
               | Last-Modified            ; Section 14.29
               | extension-header


The ones that look relevant:
* Don't worry about caching for now. It should only matter when loading a
  different profile. I can worry about that case later.
* "Connection: close", since we don't support consistent connections yet.
* Date: ..., which we are supposed to send always.
*  

Aside from Date, looks like none are required. Maybe also Content-Type? Some
others could be useful.

How about we start with something like:

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html
  Last-Modified: Sat, 08 Jan 2022 20:18:45 GMT (date of profile file)
  Date: Tue, 22 Oct 2024 14:11:07 GMT

I dunno. Start with nothing, see what elinks accepts. No reason to go above
and beyond here.
