@test no-error @@

Basic use of head builtin:

@assert_eq[@head[hello]][h]

Test for head of empty string:

@assert_eq[@head[]][]

Test that we evaluate the argument to head first.

@assert_eq[a]
 @let[x][abcde] @@
 @head[@x]

Regression test for a bug where head didn't work properly if its argument was
represented as a sequence internally:

@let[h][h] @@
@let[i][i] @@
@assert_eq[@head[@h@i]][h]


End of tests.
