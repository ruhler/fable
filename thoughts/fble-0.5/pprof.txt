For discussion of the UI that I want.

Here's a concrete use case I feel like I want:
1. View the list of blocks by percent of time the program spent in or under
   that block.
2. Maybe we could merge together similar blocks in the list so there is less
   to look at.
3. Be able to easily 'remove' a block from that list. Which removes any
   samples that have that block anywhere in it.

So I collect together a list of interesting blocks by removing one after the
other. Now I have a high level summary breakdown of where time is going. Then
I want to be able to focus at one of those blocks at a time. Rinse and repeat?
