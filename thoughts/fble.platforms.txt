Fble Platforms
==============
It's all well and good to try writing apps in fble that I run locally, but can
you really imagine someone else using my apps? What we really need is some
support for cross platform apps that work in ways that users expect from
today.

Issues to consider:
* Can we run fble programs on windows, Android, iOS?
  - What compiler support do we need for different architectures?
  - How does performance look on those platforms?
* Some environment for building for different platforms.
* Support for standard UI components
  - mouse, touch events, window close events.
  - menus, buttons, widgets, etc.
  - fonts and images.
  - animations and sound.
  - save and restore user data from disk.
* Should we have more general interpreter support?
  - For example, to let users write and run fble code without having to
    compile it? Perhaps they can link to compiled libraries for performance,
    and it's fine if they are just writing the driver code?

For example, I could write, say, a tictactoe game in godot framework, with
artwork, sound, text, animations, shadows, menus, mouse and touch input, etc.
Then run that app on Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, Mac, and in the browser.

Then the question is: can I do the same thing in fble? Can I make it so I can
do the same thing in fble? What would that take?

If I wanted to take fble to the next level, this would be it.

Thoughts on how to test different platforms conveniently:
* VirtualBox only supports x86?
* QEMU looks like it has user mode emulation, which could be useful?

For example, maybe I can run qemu-arm and qemu-i386 and qemu-x86_64

Note, that's a different approach than setting up a virtual machine, for
example, with a different distro running on it. I'm not even sure I could run
a virtual machine for an x86 device on an arm processor.
