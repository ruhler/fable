Fble 0.6 TODO
=============
Things to consider doing for the fble-0.6 release.

* Optimize C and interpreter backends like we did aarch64?
  By inlining logic to access fble values instead of calling library
  functions.

* Make programs run twice as fast.
 - Use native stack for stack allocations.
 - Inline FbleCall into aarch64 backend.
 - Specialize call logic based on what we can figure out statically in terms
   of number of args expected and tail/non-tail possibilities.

* Implement deflate algorithm.
 - Change --profile to produce gzip compressed profiles (doesn't need to be
   compressed yet, can use uncompressed blocks).
 - Change fble-pprof to decompress profiles.

* Fix potential GC gen overflow?
 - See thoughts/fble-0.3/stack_alloc.txt for details.
 - See thoughts/fble-0.5/gc.txt for more thoughts.
